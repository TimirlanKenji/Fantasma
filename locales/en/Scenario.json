   "Ev01_Desc" : " You stop in a dark corridor. By listening, you recognize human screams. The sounds come from the ventilation shaft, which is located in the wall not far from you. Going to the hole you can recognize some words. This is a request for help.",

   "Ev01_Ch2" : " Hell no!",
   "Ev01_Ch3" : " Use flashlight",
   "Ev01_Ch1Win" : "<br> You peer into the darkness of the mine. The ventilation chute goes into the wall, and then abruptly breaks down. You hear a woman on the other end asking for help. You talk to her, calm her down and promise that you will help her when you go down to the floor below. This short conversation motivates you and strengthens your hope for survival.",
   "Ev01_Ch1Fail" : "<br> Approaching the ventilation, you peer into the darkness and listen. The shadows in the gutter take on eerie shapes, and the sounds of the voice are replaced by indistinct screams. With shaking hands, you close the shaft lid and runs away.",
   "Ev01_Ch2Des" : " Hell no! <br> You regain control of your body and try to get out of here as quickly as possible. You're trying to forget what just happened to you, but it's not that easy.",
   "Ev01_Ch3Yes" : " Highlight with a flashlight<br> Approaching the shaft, you leave it with the light of a lantern. In the presence of dust and cobwebs, you find an object and understand it. How could it be here?",

   "Ev02_Name" : "                      Garbage chute with a corpse<br>",
   "Ev02_Desc" : " The air around you is saturated with sweet notes of decay. Suddenly you are attracted to something unnatural. Human legs, shod in classic loafers, stick out of the garbage chute. After a cursory examination, you realize that the corpse has been in this position for several days. On the wall where the garbage chute is located, you notice occult symbols.",
   "Ev02_Ch1" : " Study the symbols",
   "Ev02_Ch2" : " Call for help",
   "Ev02_Ch3" : " Do nothing",
   "Ev02_Ch1Win" : "<br> You remember the runes that you met in an old book. Pronouncing the names of the written runes in order, you feel a strange vibration in your body. It looks like you've learned a new spell.",
   "Ev02_Ch1Fail" : "<br> Nonsense written by a madman will drive you crazy.",
   "Ev02_Ch2Win" : "<br>  You scream for help with all the strength of your lungs. Suddenly, the next door opens and an elderly lady comes out. With quick movements, she pushes the corpse into the gutter and closes the lid. Without answering your questions, she returns to her apartment and closes the door with a bolt. You are invigorated by the thought that not all maniacs in this building.",
   "Ev02_Ch2Fail" : "<br> You scream for help, tearing your vocal cords. Hoarse, you realize that you have lost your voice. What's even worse: no one answered your call.",
   "Ev02_Ch3Des" : " Do nothing <br> The smell makes my eyes water and I can't breathe. You are trying to escape from the sickening sight, but the taste of rot has settled on your tongue.",

   "Ev03_Ch3" : " Pass by",
   "Ev03_Ch1Win" : "<br>  You notice a crooked hanging picture. Removing it to the side, you find a mechanism that is activated by a button. With a shaking hand, you press the button and the section of wall in front of you turns and is installed perpendicular to the load-bearing wall. In the hole in front of you is a safe room in which you find.",
   "Ev03_Ch1Fail" : "<br> All you see is old peeling wallpaper, from under which fat cockroaches crawl out. There is nothing special here. Are you hallucinating?",
   "Ev03_Ch2Win" : "<br>  You press on the edge of the wall and it gives in. Half-turned, the mechanism of the cache stops. You collect a small amount of cash in the storage room and walk away.",
   "Ev03_Ch2Fail" : "<br> Despite the sharp pain in your back, you push against the wall with all your might, but you achieve nothing but a quiet creak. There was definitely something behind the layer of thick wood, but you won't know what it was.",
   "Ev03_Ch3Des" : " Pass by <br> The damn hotel seems to be laughing at you. You attribute what you saw to the play of your frightened and tired mind and move on.",   
   "Ev04_Name" : "                      Donor children<br>",
   "Ev04_Desc" : " A dull groan makes you stop. In a slightly open room you can see beds on which several children are lying, all wearing gas masks. Tubes protrude from their veins, through which a red liquid flows. All the tubes lead to a large pump next to the beds. Who needed so much baby blood and why?",
   "Ev04_Ch1" : " Remove the tubes ",
   "Ev04_Ch2" : " Inspect the pump",
   "Ev04_Ch3" : " Leave the place",
   "Ev04_Ch1Win" : "<br>  Gently you pull the needle out of the hand of the first child. Tearing off a piece of cloth, you wrap a pressure bandage around your arm. The kid under the mask does not say thank you. He's still lying on the cot, as if he's sleeping. You notice the child's weak breathing. After repeating the procedure with the rest of the children, you leave with a calm soul. When you get out of here, be sure to tell the police about it.",
   "Ev04_Ch1Fail" : "<br> You pull the needle out of the child's vein, but you don't have time to prepare the bandage. Blood spurts from a small pen while you figure out how to dress the wound. When you finally find the tissue, there is almost no blood flowing. The floor is covered with blood, your psyche is broken. You leave the children and leave soon, let these specialists deal with.",
   "Ev04_Ch2Win" : "<br>  Intuition tells you to look at the device. A huge pump serves as a centrifuge in which blood is processed and converted into plasma. You know this because you were once a donor too. But where do the substances go? Apparently, through the tube through the hole to the lower floor.",
   "Ev04_Ch2Fail" : "<br> You carefully approach the pump and begin the inspection. Putting your hands on the edge, you try to climb up to get a better look at it from above. At this moment, the centrifuge cuts off two fingers on your right hand.",
   "Ev04_Ch3Des" : " Leave the place <br> You turn around and run away like a coward. But there are still children in gas masks in front of you, from which life is being drained.",

   "Ev05_Desc" : " You regret that you entered this room. The smell of decomposition makes your eyes water. It's hard to find the source of the smell in this mess. However, your attention is attracted by a dirty mattress sewn in the middle with a thick thread.",
   "Ev05_Ch1" : " Rip the mattress ",
   "Ev05_Ch2" : " Cut the thread [KNIFE]",
   "Ev05_Ch1Win" : "<br>  You flex your muscles and pull the thread. The fabric of the mattress is torn by the tension of the thread and you tear the seam. Under the poor light, you see a putrid mass with bones sticking out of it, similar to human ribs. In the blood and pus, you notice an object. Squeezing nausea, you stick your hand into this bloody mess and take out the contents.",
   "Ev05_Ch1Fail" : "<br> With all your strength you pull at the end of the seam. A sharp thread pierces into your palms and you feel a cutting pain. A few drops of blood disappear in the cut of the mattress. At this moment, something that has tasted blood breaks out of the womb of the mattress.",
   "Ev05_Ch2Des" : " Cut the thread <br> With the blade, you cut the thread along the entire mattress. Under the poor light, you see a putrid mass with bones sticking out of it, similar to human ribs. In the blood and pus, you notice an object. Forcing nausea, you put your hand into this bloody mess and take out the item.",
   "Ev06_Name" : "                      Blurry photo<br>",
   "Ev06_Desc" : " The photo is on the coffee table, on top of randomly scattered books. Something unnatural in the picture attracts your attention and you take the photo in your hands. The blurry photo shows a strange creature that you have never seen before.",
   "Ev06_Ch1" : " Flip the picture  ",
   "Ev06_Ch2" : " Study photos ",
   "Ev06_Ch1Win1" : "<br> You turn the picture over and read on the back: <Level 1 parasite. Introduced to the object ",
   "Ev06_Ch1Win2" : " through the mouth opening.> The date is signed below. This is today's date. You begin to realize that a parasite is developing inside you. You can use this knowledge.",
   "Ev06_Ch1Fail" : "<br> Turning the photo, you study what is written. But because of the dim light, you can't read these untranslatable scribbles. With regret, you are postponing a strange photo.",
   "Ev06_Ch2Win" : "<br> You are carefully studying the creature in the photograph. It looks like an insect with multiple legs. You realize that the picture is enlarged, and the blur is due to the fact that the creature is in a glass vessel. Suddenly you remember that you saw something similar in the encyclopedia of biology.",
   "Ev06_Ch2Fail" : "<br> A strange creature similar to a centipede in some strange solution. The more you look at the image, the scarier you get.",
   "Ev07_Name" : "                      Immured woman<br>",
   "Ev07_Desc" : " A woman is looking at you from a hole in the wall. Taken aback, you stop and peer into a strange vision. It looks like someone tried to immure a person in the wall - spatulas, cement mortar and bricks are lying on the floor. The woman's face peeking out of the hole looks like a corpse. You can guess that it's not her first day here. Apparently, she somehow managed to crack the hole herself, so as not to suffocate in the wall.",
   "Ev07_Ch1" : " Get the woman out ",
   "Ev07_Ch2" : " To talk ",
   "Ev07_Ch3" : " Ignore ",
   "Ev07_Ch1Win" : "<br> You rush to the wall and start breaking it with your hands. Either you are too strong, or the bricks were glued with poor-quality cement, but soon you are holding a fragile woman's body in your hands. She is dehydrated, her body is covered with scabs. She opens her eyes and barely audibly says <Thank you...>, before closing her eyes forever. You leave the corpse against the wall. You are warmed by the thought that you have at least tried...",
   "Ev07_Ch1Fail" : "<br> You are trying to pull out the bricks sticking out of the hole. After taking some time, you break your hands in blood, but still get the woman out of the hole. It's too late. She's not breathing anymore. You put her corpse on the floor and continue on your way.",
   "Ev07_Ch2Win" : "<br> A sixth sense tells you that a woman will not survive extraction. You sit down next to the hole, quietly and calmly trying to talk to her. She manages to answer a few of your questions in her hoarse voice before she dies.",
   "Ev07_Ch2Fail" : "<br> You pounce on a woman with questions. You shout, demand, and question. In response, the woman only slowly closes her eyes and falls asleep? Dying? You don't know. With bitterness in your heart, you leave her alone in this brick and cement coffin.",
   "Ev07_Ch3Des" : " Ignore<br> You walk by as if you don't notice the woman. It's like you don't see the eyes turned on you. You do not feel the smell of rotting living flesh.",
   "Ev08_Name" : "                      The Bible in the hotel<br>",
   "Ev08_Desc" : " A dusty book on the coffee table attracts your attention. You pick up the attribute of any room in any lousy hotel. And although this hotel is the worst you've ever met in your life, now is probably the right time to ask God for help.",
   "Ev08_Ch1" : " Study the book ",
   "Ev08_Ch2" : " Open on a random page",
   "Ev08_Ch3" : " Leave the book",
   "Ev08_Ch1Win" : "<br> Remembering the theology course at the university, you open the Bible. While reading, you notice comments written in pencil on the margins of the pages. By studying the book, you stimulate memory and confirm old truths.",
   "Ev08_Ch1Fail" : "<br> The story of Christ written in the old syllable does not arouse your interest. While reading, you fall asleep unnoticed by yourself. Opening your eyes, you try to figure out how much time has passed.",
   "Ev08_Ch2Win" : "<br> Trusting your sixth sense, you open on a random page. For a while you read the fragment and feel that hope is instilling in you. After all, this is exactly what no one will ever be able to kill. Emboldened, you put the book back in its place and continue on your way.",
   "Ev08_Ch2Fail" : "<br> The sixth sense has failed you. Opening the book on a random page, you realize that you got a disturbing passage. You flip through it several times, but the text is still tense. Tired, you throw the book aside. You think even books are cursed in this hotel.",
   "Ev08_Ch3Des" : " Leave the book <br> You are not one of those who eat opium for the people. Leave these prejudices to the fanatics and go your own way. But why is it so cold and lonely?...",

   "Ev09_Desc" : " Squelching bare feet on the flooded room, you approach the bathroom. Inside, the bodies of a man and a woman are drifting in unnatural poses. The corpses seemed to merge with each other in bizarre poses. You notice a shiny object clamped between the victims' thighs. To get it, you will have to climb into the water.",
   "Ev09_Ch1" : " Try to pull the item out  ",
   "Ev09_Ch2" : " Look around carefully",
   "Ev09_Ch3" : " Leave the place",
   "Ev09_Ch1Win" : "<br> You have to get into the tub with the rotting corpses. Water pours onto the floor when your feet sink into the murky green slush. Wincing at the smell, you pull the handle and take out a double-edged stiletto clamped between the bodies. Jumping out of the tub, you are happy that you got off with only a minor fright.",
   "Ev09_Ch1Fail" : "<br> You climb into the bathroom and immediately slip on the woman's hair. Hitting the edge of the tub painfully, you scream. You feel the bitter taste of poisoned water. Clearing your throat, you climb back out, leaving the item untouched.",
   "Ev09_Ch2Win" : "<br> During the inspection of the bath, you note that the bodies in the bathroom are not the first day. The water is probably poisoned by putrefaction products, hence the characteristic smell and color. A drain plug is found under the bathroom. You tear it off and the contents of the tub pour into the sewer hole in the floor. Without liquid support, the corpses go limp and you easily pull out the object.",
   "Ev09_Ch2Fail" : "<br> You inspect corpses and a bathtub. You come to the conclusion that it is better not to try your luck and not touch the water. Not finding a way to retrieve the item, you leave with regret for the wasted time.",
   "Ev09_Ch3Des" : " Leave the room <br> Whatever happened here, it's none of your business. You walk away, trying to drive away a creepy vision- two intertwined decomposing bodies in a dirty bathroom.",

   "Ev10_Desc" : " Suddenly, the floor collapses under you. What you thought was a toilet mat turned out to be a disguised trap. You manage to grab the edge of the pit with one hand. A meter below you, boiling liquid is bubbling. You have time to notice a motionless skeleton at the bottom of the pit. The sour smell of solvent hits the nose. You try to lift yourself on your hands, but the edges are slippery and you are about to fall to the bottom of the pit.",
   "Ev10_Ch1" : " Jump down  ",
   "Ev10_Ch2" : " Push off the wall",
   "Ev10_Ch3" : " [PERK] The Equilibrist",
   "Ev10_Ch1Win" : "<br> You unclench your hands and land in boiling liquid. You are in pain, but not as much as expected. It seems that your stiffened skin is not so easy to hurt. Slowly you examine the skeleton. In the pocket of the poor guy you find something useful. After completing the inspection, you climb up, pushing off simultaneously with your hands and feet from two walls of the pit. Whose sick mind came up with this?",
   "Ev10_Ch1Fail" : "<br> Jumping down, you immediately feel unbearable pain. My feet seemed to sink into boiling lava. Going crazy with pain, you dance, jumping from one foot to the other. Finally, you manage to climb the skeleton and reach the edge of the pit. When you get out, you examine your acid-scalded feet. Red with swollen blisters, it is very painful to step on them.",
   "Ev10_Ch2Win" : "<br> You're trying to execute a crazy idea. Repenting, you jump on the wall and push off with your feet. The speed is enough to make you half over the pit with a powerful jerk. Pulling up your legs, you manage to climb up. Lying next to the pit, you scroll through your trick in your head to remember and use in the future.",
   "Ev10_Ch2Fail" : "<br> Your plan is to push off from the next wall and jerk yourself out of the pit. But as soon as your feet touch the wall, they immediately fall down. You fall into boiling water and immediately earn several burns. Somehow you manage to climb up the remains of the skeleton.",
   "Ev10_Ch3Des" : " [PERK] The Equilibrist <br> Repenting, you jump on the wall and push off with your feet. The speed is enough to make you half over the pit with a powerful jerk. Pulling up your legs, you manage to climb up.",

He is covered with cuts and wounds, indicating that he, like you, survived terrible hours in this hotel. You are ready to swear that you see the handle of some weapon under his chest. However, you cannot determine whether a person is breathing or not. Maybe it's a trap. And he's waiting for you to come closer to deal a critical blow?.",
   "Ev11_Ch1" : " Take a weapon ",
   "Ev11_Ch2" : " Don't push your luck",
   "Ev11_Ch1Win" : "<br> As soon as you approach the body, your whole being begins to scream in horror. At the last second, you take a step back. Just in time, because just after that, a sharp blade cut through the air in front of your nose. A man with eyes red with anger rushes at you!",
   "Ev11_Ch1Fail" : "<br> You feel something like itching in the pit of your stomach. But you don't pay attention to it. In the next moment, two things happen: you feel a sharp pain - this blade split your chest, and then an armed madman attacked you.",
   "Ev11_Ch2Des" : " Don't push your luck <br> You approach the opposite wall quietly, like a mouse. And now, along the wall, you crawl past the body of the unknown.",

   "Ev12_Desc" : " Without suspecting anything, you push the door in front of you and go inside the dark room. The door closes with a bang and you refuse in pitch darkness. Suddenly you hear a hiss, as if a hose with compressed air has burst. You feel the sour smell and understand- Gas!",

   "Ev12_Ch2" : " Hold the breath",
   "Ev12_Ch3" : " [PERK] Tough Dash ",
   "Ev12_Ch1Win" : "<br>  Realizing that you have very little time, you gain distance and turn around. Having prepared yourself, you run to the door with a jerk and knocks it out of its hinges with your whole body. Swallowing clean air, you rub your bruised shoulder. By memorizing this technique, you intend to use it in the future.",
   "Ev12_Ch1Fail" : "<br> You turn around abruptly and rush to the door. You hit the door again and again with your feet and hands. The damn door gives in when you've had enough of the gas. Falling out of the room, you fall to your knees and spit out the contents of your stomach on the carpet.",
   "Ev12_Ch2Win" : "<br> Remembering the workouts in the pool, you take in full lungs of air and hold your breath. Calmly, saving your strength, you study the room. You plug the gap in the wall from where the gas was supplied and find the key to the door. When you leave the room, you exhale with relief.",
   "Ev12_Ch2Fail" : "<br> After taking a deep breath, you start exploring the room. Your movements are fast and you realize that there is not enough air for you. Having finally found the key to the door, you are already suffocating greedily swallowing the poisoned air. You fall out of the room and vomit on the floor.",

   "Ev13_Ch1" : " Catch a stake ",
   "Ev13_Ch2" : " Trace the flight path",
   "Ev13_Ch1Win" : "<br> You quickly clap your hands in front of you and clamp the stake aimed at your heart. You manage to extinguish the blow so that the blade only grazes your chest a little. Dropping the stake, you calmly inspect the pantry.",
   "Ev13_Ch1Fail" : "<br> You catch a stake, but it slips along your arms and digs into your ribs. You scream in pain as you pull yourself off the stake. Looking at the wound, you see a broken rib. A little more and the pin pierced your heart.",
   "Ev13_Ch2Win" : "<br> At the moment of the stake's departure, you notice the trajectory of its flight. Your body is now in such a position that if you don't change it, the stake will fly by. You force yourself to freeze in this position and hear the whistle of a metal stake next to your ear. Exhaling, you inspect the pantry.",
   "Ev13_Ch2Fail" : "<br> It seems to you that you notice that the stake is flying by. However, your instincts fail you - you turn around, trying to dodge, but thereby exposing yourself to the blow. The stake pierces your shoulder through and through, you scream in unbearable pain.",

   "Ev16_Ch1" : " Inspect the ceiling ",
   "Ev16_Ch2" : " Run away",
   "Ev16_Ch1Win" : "<br> You take a closer look at the red spot on the ceiling. You notice how unnaturally the stain spreads. The edges of the liquid flow unevenly in different directions, forming small rivulets of blood. You realize that you are faced with a living organism.",
   "Ev16_Ch1Fail" : "<br> Carefully examining the ceiling, you miss what is happening below you. The red liquid has already flowed to the floor and has begun to surround you. When you realize this, you try to escape, but it's too late. The red tentacle is already flying in your direction.",

   "Ev17_Ch1Fail" : "<br> You put the first portion in your mouth. You have never had to taste such strange meat. But you can't stop, you keep eating. After finishing your meal, you get up, take a couple of steps and regurgitate what you've eaten on the floor.",
   "Ev17_Ch2Win" : "<br> After examining the room, you think logically. Someone and for some reason left so much food here. There was a banquet here, but almost touched. And it is difficult to guess who owned this meat. Having suppressed your hunger, you leave the strange hall.",

   "Ev18_Ch2Des" : " Use first Aid kit<br> You approach the woman, clutching a first aid kit in your hands. Without touching the ropes, you carefully treat her wounds. When you finish, the woman quietly says <Thank you...> and this single word warms your soul like a ray of sunshine.",

   "Ev19_Ch1Fail" : "<br> You feel like you're seeing dry places. You stand there with your bare foot, but it was just a reflection. You are electrocuted. It's too late to retreat, so you quickly run through the water. Your knees buckle and you fall on the other side of the puddle. The trembling in the body after electrical discharges cannot calm down for a long time.",

At this moment, the parasite in the jar clicks its long mandibles and in fright you let the jar out of your hands. The glass breaks, splashing the solution. You have time to notice how the parasite crawls under the closet, where it cannot be reached.",

Useful and not so useful items are scattered in it.",
