   "Document1_2":"At times I feel like I'm losing my mind. Those strange statues sticking out of the walls might be talking or my sanity is failing me.<br>",
   "Document1_3":"I've tried everything but I can't get out, the elevator just doesn't work, it feels like the hotel doesn't want to let me out. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, this is just a building, not a living thing.<br>",
   "Document1_4":"Possibly December 10, 1981.<br>I noticed something, in an attempt to add light to my hideout, I lit the torch that the statue is holding. So it lit up with a strange purple flame, and the statue began to seem to talk to me.<br>",

   "Document13_1":"The history of torture can be traced back to the Neolithic. Archaeologists have found several mass graves in which victims of systematic violence are buried. Torture was also used in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, South America and Asia. The ancient states did not disdain this.<br>",
   "Document13_2":"One of the most famous examples is the copper bull. The victim was placed in a designated structure, under which a bonfire was built. Thanks to the unique structure, the screams coming from inside resembled a roar. In the future, human fantasy only expanded the ways of self-mutilation.<br>",
   "Document13_3":"The purposes of the use of torture were different, from ritual murders to one of the components of the criminal process. By subjecting the defendant to torment, it was possible to obtain the necessary information, for example, a confession of witchcraft. There were examples of demonstrative torture.<br>",

The practice of this rite is known among the Slavs, ancient Greeks and Romans, as well as in India, where laying on a bonfire is still one of the most popular funeral methods.<br>",
   "Document14_2":"In the belief of ancient people, burning allowed the soul of the deceased to move to heaven together with the smoke. From there, he could help his relatives by sending, for example, rain. In addition, cremation allowed a person to find final rest.<br>",
   "Document14_3":"There are cases when an incapacitated member of the community was burned, believing that in this way he would be able to get rid of a serious condition. Now the rite has become somewhat poorer in ceremonial terms. After all, previously his personal belongings were placed with the deceased, which were supposed to accompany him in the other world.<br>",
   "Document14_4":"And more attention was paid to the subsequent procedures after the ashes were placed in the urn. Now, in most countries, it is more of a utilitarian event, especially in big cities. And it is not connected with a mystical and otherworldly ritual, but with a religious one.<br>",
