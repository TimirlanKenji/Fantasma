   "Prologue_1": "An increasingly popular punk rock band traveled from west to east. Concerts in bars and clubs across the country died down. From shabby eateries to hot spots for those who like to waste money.<br>The time has come to give the final performance - in the city of Pilgrim- City.",
   "Prologue_2": "The venue is a notorious abandoned hotel in the area. However, the notoriety of this place did not stop the local daredevils. Among the punks, people who seemed alien to such places also infiltrated.",
   "Prologue_3": "A veterinarian, an artist, a fitness trainer and a frontman. The destinies of these four were intertwined. And the concert itself became a catalyst, awakening a fairly bored old-timer of these parts.",
   "Prologue_4": "Without fear, pumped up with alcohol, the company decided to take an unprecedented step. In a foggy mind, the ancient hotel building looked incredibly alluring.<br>Curiosity was inflamed and several expressive stories from drunk local punks.",
   "Prologue_4_1": "Whatever happened in this secluded place: mysterious disappearances, prostitution, dirt and dishonor, crime and greed.<br>The surroundings created in this way worked as an ideal bait.",
   "Prologue_5": "Without much thought, the crowd opened the gates to the empty establishment.<br>This hotel stay will be the most unforgettable and mind-blowingly shocking for them.",

   "ProlSelena_01": "The passage is closed and there is no way forward.",
   "ProlSelena_02": "And where is our long-haired star? It seems to me that he was about to relieve himself.",
   "ProlSelena_03": "It seems to me, or do I hear the groans of the beast outside the door?",
   "ProlSelena_04": "I'll leave him alone.",
   "ProlSelena_05": "This is what hedonism leads to.<br>Unhappy man, can you speak coherently?",
   "ProlSelena_06": "If you've lost words, then at least moo!",
   "ProlSelena_07": "Decisively. Decisively, all this looks like a bad dream...",
   "ProlSelena_08": "Damnity. Morality. Or an obsession? What happened? They added dope, poison, poison. What kind of nightmare?",
   "ProlSelena_08_1": "Need to look around.",
   "ProlSelena_09": "A big hole... in the bed? Who came up with the idea of making a hole in the mattress? And is that blood on the edges?",
   "ProlSelena_10": "You could even hide a person here. Superfluous and unnecessary.<br>Like me...",
   "ProlSelena_11": "Cheap underwear with a hint of eroticism. Dildos. Condoms and birth control. Looks like the princess who lived here was fully armed.",
   "ProlSelena_12": "Oh, who are you, femme fatale, who drove married ordinary people crazy with your charms?",
   "ProlSelena_13": "But it doesn't look like ANY person has set foot on these lands in many years.<br>Where does all this come from?",
   "ProlSelena_14": "An ordinary and inexpressive table. Its boredom and ordinariness could be glorified in an equally boring legend.",
   "ProlSelena_15": "But who, by mercy, wiped all the dust off him?",
   "ProlSelena_16": "What kind of pig leaves a used syringe in the sink? Children could get hurt.",
   "ProlSelena_17": "Someone's torn jeans are lying... No, no, what a wonderful dream. The hotel shows no signs of life. I definitely have delirium.",
   "ProlSelena_18": "They have nowhere to come from. These wretched torn jeans, smeared with sewage and blood.",
   "ProlSelena_19": "This simply cannot happen in reality.",
   "ProlSelena_20": "Fiction for the past thirty years. And there's nothing to catch the eye on.",
   "ProlSelena_21": "I'm very curious, is there anything related to painting here?",
   "ProlSelena_22": "Alas, but hopes are in vain. Only stories about foggy port towns.",
   "ProlSelena_23": "It's very amazing, you can hear beeps. My foggy mind, having suffered from drunkenness, continues to mock me.",
   "ProlSelena_24": "Disgusting! Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting! What kind of damn ugliness is this! God!",
   "ProlSelena_24_1": "Help, you need to urgently call for help, find someone who could provide help, find help.",
   "ProlSelena_25": "Luckily for you, there is a reception number next to the phone. Having dialed it with trembling fingers, you wait with bated breath. A vice grips your chest with the premonition that something unknown is about to pounce on you from behind. But, to relief, the beeps are interrupted by a man's voice.",
   "ProlSelena_25_1": "Hello! Motherfucker, who is this? Hello!",
   "ProlSelena_25_2": "Hey! Who's there? Can you hear me? Hello! I'm stuck in the room! There's some nasty shit here, I can't get out!",
   "ProlSelena_25_3": "Who's saying what? Where? What the hell? Are you kidding me?",
   "ProlSelena_25_4": "You're that long-haired one! Chris! Open this damn door!",
   "ProlSelena_25_5": "Baby, is that you? What door? Are you crazy there? Is this some kind of fucking prank? I...",
   "ProlSelena_25_6": "After this, the connection is interrupted, leaving you alone with yourself.",
   "ProlSelena_25_7": "The exit is blocked by a door made of flesh.",
   "ProlSelena_25_8": "I can't get out of here, there is no way to salvation...",
   "ProlSelena_26": "Ah! What the hell? Damn phone, damn hotel! But maybe it's Chris?",
   "ProlSelena_26_1": "Hoping to hear a familiar voice, you realize with bewilderment that there is a stranger on the other end of the line. Confidence and courtesy shine through in his words, he is clearly not a stranger in this wretched place.",
   "ProlSelena_26_2": "Good evening, Miss Selena. We have been notified of a slight problem with your door lock. Don't worry, we have already sent a concierge to sort it out.",
   "ProlSelena_26_3": "Hey! Who are you!? What concierge? Are you one of Chris's friends? What kind of ridiculous and lame jokes are these!?",
   "ProlSelena_26_4": "While waiting, you can while away the time with a book. Our rooms offer wonderful collections of literature for every taste.",
   "ProlSelena_26_5": "Hey! This is not funny! What the hell are these books? What kind of ridiculous nonsense!?",
   "ProlSelena_26_6": "Your appeals fall into the abyss, remaining unanswered. The connection is cut off again.",
   "ProlSelena_27": "No! No! Not again! What kind of crazy, poisoned place is this! Damned, perverted place! How do I get out of here!?",
   "ProlSelena_28": "In the name of all that is holy, finally! All that's left is to get out of here.",
   "ProlSelena_28_1": "I hope this is all just a bad, drunken dream, a nightmare, the likes of which I have never had before...",
   "ProlSelena_29": "Oh gods, what kind of deeds am I forced to do for the sake of my own salvation. Once I get out, I wake up, I am forced to capture all this on canvas.",
   "ProlSelena_29_1": "I don't need to go back to the damn room.",
   "ProlSelena_29_2": "Finally! The long-awaited freedom, liberation from the shackles of a nightmare!",
   "ProlSelena_30": "Oh no! Oh, Gods! Not again, please, not again!",
   "ProlSelena_30_1": "In front of you, something difficult to describe appears from the fog. A bloody and purulent pile of meat, with worms swarming in open wounds, covered with mucus, is heading towards you. Previous deformities pale in comparison with this disgusting monster.",
   "ProlSelena_30_2": "Frozen with horror, you stand pinned to the floor, unable to resist.",
   "ProlSelena_30_3": "The door is locked, with weakening hands you scratch it, leaving scarlet bloody grooves on the surface. But everything is in vain.",
   "ProlSelena_30_4": "No! No! Please, open, save! Someone, help! I beg! Chris! Someone, save!",
   "ProlSelena_31": "Endless volumes of printed publications are placed on the shelves. They are literally bursting with books of all kinds of sizes and colors. Their spines are full of absurd titles. Who would think of calling the work “A Talentless Nonentity: Or How to Waste Your Life for Nothing”?" ,
   "ProlSelena_32": "Among the literature, you see books that influenced your work. Such as, for example, “Artistic techniques and techniques.” Such an inconspicuous name hides the confession of a master. A man who devoted himself to ugly painting, glorifying decay and death. Your favorite book ",
   "ProlSelena_33": "The more you study the shelves, the more obvious it becomes that these books are about you. The desire to escape from reality, to get away from everyday life, to renounce people, making them nothing more than a tool. These and other motives are suppressed you, are revealed in the titles of works.",
   "ProlSelena_34": "An unremarkable door. It seems that only the impossibility of getting through it differs from many other similar doors in this place.",
   "ProlSelena_35": "A locked door. Only it is marked by a bright pink bra hanging on the door handle. And it is guarded by a high leather boot. It seems that some of the concert participants wore similar shoes.",
   "ProlSelena_36": "What's behind this door? Nothing. Literal nothingness, drowning in tar darkness, just as thick and viscous, denying the very idea of the existence of anything. You hastily close the door.",
   "Chris0":"------------------------------------------------CHRIS-------------------------------------------------",
   "Chris":"Chris",
   "ProlChris_1": "An old, cracked toilet. It is half filled with foul-smelling vomit, whose acrid smell causes pain in the eyes.",
   "ProlChris_2": "D-damn, well, I'm fed up...<br>...holy, how my guts are twisting. Is there something here? Shit, I have to look for it.",
   "ProlChris_3": "M-mother f..., I need to throw in the shit. I'm still in the shit.",
   "ProlChris_3_1": "Fuck... Empty.",
   "ProlChris_3_2": "Oh crap! There's no shit here.",
   "ProlChris_3_3": "What do we have here?..",
   "ProlChris_4": "T-that's good! My head like that toilet is full of shit now, but at least it's not stormy anymore.<br>So what next? Damn, we need to find these dudes, these morons.",
   "ProlChris_5": "An impressive oak counter. All kinds of stationery, like a thick registration book, are covered with a layer of dust.",
    "ProlChris_5_1": "However, someone managed to leave two round bald spots on the edge, along with a package of condoms lying under the table.",
   "ProlChris_5_2": "Nothing else stands out about this dust collector.",
   "ProlChris_5_3": "Yellowed advertising brochures, famous fashion magazines and several leaflets. More than 30 years have passed since this waste paper was relevant.",
   "ProlChris_5_4": "It's all the more unexpected to find an advertising poster for your group among a pile of papers.",
   "ProlChris_5_5": "What the fuck is this doing here?",
   "ProlChris_5_6": "The door is locked. A small trail of fresh leaves breaks near it.",
   "ProlChris_5_7": "The door is tightly boarded up with boards.",
   "ProlChris_5_8": "The door can't be opened. A strange, slightly sweet smell can be heard near it.",
   "ProlChris_5_9": "Communication device. Currently silent. Unless you want to contact the world of eternal silence.",
   "ProlChris_5_10": "Old phone. What else can you expect from it?",
   "ProlChris_5_11": "Hello! The game developers are in touch. We want to say thank you for deciding to play our game.",
   "ProlChris_5_12": "The true power of alcohol, capable of killing even the most persistent. And judging by his appearance, this character is not particularly strong.",
   "ProlChris_5_13": "But his little canine friend, despite his touching appearance, is ready to defend his owner's peace to the last.",
   "ProlChris_5_14": "Shu! Get out! Get off, damned dog! Fuck this severed one didn't give in to me.",
   "ProlChris_5_15": "The Administrator's neatly folded and ironed clothes.",
   "ProlChris_5_16": "The gold-plated badge on the suit announces the owner's name- Theodore Anzeba.",
   "ProlChris_6": "Hey! You're that girl from the concert. What are you doing here?",
   "ProlChris_6_1": "Oh! Hello! I found this showcase, so many interesting things. Did you know about the Indian tribe A...",
   "ProlChris_6_2": "Yes, yes, of course, very interesting. So, where is everyone, or are you hanging around here alone?",
   "ProlChris_6_3": "Hey, Jeffrey is also here. And Selena was somewhere.",
   "ProlChris_6_4": "Are you talking about this severed man? What else is Selena?",
   "ProlChris_6_5": "Well, artist, she also joined us after your performance. By the way, it turned out great!",
   "ProlChris_6_6": "Of course it's great! Am I a super star, or what?",
   "ProlChris_6_7": "And the other guys played great too.",
   "ProlChris_6_8": "Fuck it. These assholes are not on my level. They just clung to my fame.",
   "ProlChris_6_9": "Oh my Gosh! Well, you chose the words. You know, they might get offended and leave.",
   "ProlChris_6_10": "I'll find new ones. Such garbage is everywhere like uncut dogs.",
   "ProlChris_6_11": "What a rude person you are. Could you do something good...<br>For example, help me find Selena.",
   "ProlChris_6_12": "Hell no...",
   "ProlChris_6_13": "Well, she's been gone for a long time, I'm worried about her.",
   "ProlChris_6_14": "What do I have to do with it? Keep worrying, you can go with this severed one.",
   "ProlChris_6_15": "Don't you really want to help? What if she's in trouble? What if she's in danger? She could easily get lost here. And the place is so big and old. And...",
   "ProlChris_6_16": "Okay, okay, okay! Just shut your mouth and don't talk like that! You still have to look for these morons and get out of here.",
   "ProlChris_6_17": "Oh my God! Why so rude? I might be offended.",
   "ProlChris_6_18": "Fuck it. Do you know where she went, that woman?",
   "ProlChris_6_19": "No, sorry. But, in my opinion, Jeffrey saw her last.",
   "ProlChris_6_20": "Fucking shit, now i have to wake up this weirdo.",
   "ProlChris_6_21": "Sorry, I don't know anything else. I'll be here, come back as soon as you find out something.",
   "ProlChris_6_22": "Well, did you find out anything?",
   "ProlChris_6_23": "Hell no...",
   "ProlChris_7": "What should I do with this stupid dog? Maybe I should give her something?",
   "ProlChris_7_1": "What the fuck!? What kind of bullshit was that just now?",
   "ProlChris_7_2": "Oh my God! Did you hear that too? It seems like the sound came from somewhere far away.",
   "ProlChris_7_3": "Meat?..<br>What the hell is going on here?",
   "ProlChris_7_4": "Okay, I hope this is someone's stupid joke. It's not for me to eat this shit anyway.",
   "ProlChris_7_5": "Here, you dog, eat. Make sure you don't choke.",
   "ProlChris_7_6": "Hey! Severed! Wake up, come on! Stop lying around like a sack of shit.",
   "ProlChris_7_7": "...",
   "ProlChris_7_8": "Wake up, you asshole! I'm already tired of hanging around in this stupid hotel.",
   "ProlChris_7_9": "Hmphh. Mmm-mm. What? Who? Where am I?",
   "ProlChris_7_10": "At the hotel, you drunk. Or have your brains leaked out of your ears?",
   "ProlChris_7_11": "A-and you?",
   "ProlChris_7_12": "Ah ah! Just a superstar. It looks like you really have washed out all your brains with booze.",
   "ProlChris_7_13": "But yours are in place.",
   "ProlChris_7_14": "Look, Mr. cut off is trying to snap back. Better move the rest of your mind in the direction of where the woman went.",
   "ProlChris_7_15": "Who?",
   "ProlChris_7_16": "You look like you've gone completely dumb. You're a sissy. Like you were rubbing shoulders with us. Name is Selena. Or should I tell you syllable by syllable?",
   "ProlChris_7_17": "Apparently, you still have more than 3 years of education. Elevator. Do you know what this is? She was somewhere near it.",
   "ProlChris_7_18": "Fuck you, asshole, along with your dog!",
   "ProlChris_7_19": "So that I can continue talking to this asshole.",
   "ProlChris_7_20": "Fuck this asshole.",
   "ProlChris_7_21": "I don't need any more shit from this asshole.",
   "ProlChris_8": "Hey!",
   "ProlChris_8_1":"I found out where that girl went.",
   "ProlChris_8_2": "Actually, she has a name.",
   "ProlChris_8_3": "Don't give a damn. The cut off one said that he saw her at the elevator. And, for a minute, I know what it is.",
   "ProlChris_8_4": "Wow! This is wonderful!",
   "ProlChris_8_5": "What, are you kidding me now? Are you all in agreement here!?",
   "ProlChris_8_6": "No, no! Sorry, I meant that...",
   "ProlChris_8_7": "Oh! Moms! How is this possible? I thought there was no electricity here. <br>Chris, please, can you go?",
   "ProlChris_8_8": "Coward.",
   "ProlChris_8_9": "Chris, please pick up the phone.",
   "ProlChris_8_10": "Hello! Motherfucker, who is this? Hello!",
   "ProlChris_8_11": "Hey! Who's there? Can you hear me? Hello! I'm stuck in the room! There's some nasty shit in here, I can't get out!",
   "ProlChris_8_11_1": "Who's saying what? Where? What the hell? Are you kidding me?",
   "ProlChris_8_12": "You're that long-haired one! Chris! Open this damn door!",
   "ProlChris_8_13": "Little girl, is that you? What door? Are you crazy there? Is this some kind of fucking prank? I...",
   "ProlChris_8_14": "The sudden call is also suddenly interrupted, leaving you bewildered by what is happening.",
   "ProlChris_8_15": "I don't understand shit.",
   "ProlChris_8_16": "What? Who was it?",
   "ProlChris_8_17": "This little girl. She was babbling something about the door, danger and so on. Probably a stupid joke to make fun of me.",
   "ProlChris_8_18": "Oh my God! We definitely have to help her. She might be in danger or something. Maybe she really is stuck?",
   "ProlChris_8_19": "Why won't you stop? Are you trying to sign me up for some crap again?",
   "ProlChris_8_20": "But you yourself said that you want to find the guys.",
   "ProlChris_8_21": "That doesn't mean I'm going to do it with you. Or that I'm going to do it at all.",
   "ProlChris_8_22": "There are no other options here anyway. Or you can stay with Jeffrey. I'm sure you can make friends.",
   "ProlChris_8_23": "May you all die, be resurrected, and then die again! Worse than a pain in the ass.",
   "ProlChris_8_24": "Hurray! So, will you help me?",
   "ProlChris_8_25": "Holy crap, do I have a choice?",
   "ProlChris_8_26": "God, thank you! But where should we go?",
   "ProlChris_8_27": "Fuck it, figure it out yourself. I'm not going to follow your instructions anymore.",
   "ProlChris_8_28": "I'm fed up with this little babble. What's more, I found an errand boy.",
   "ProlChris_10": "Like a ridge, the shaft of an ancient elevator rushes upward, piercing the ceiling, rising to the next floors. A silent, blackened structure. Its scorched buttons look like the grimaces of people being burned alive. And the blood of electricity has not circulated through the wire-veins for a long time." ,
   "ProlChris_11": "Oh my God! This place comes to life before our eyes! First the phone, now this.",
   "ProlChris_11_1": "Fucking hotel. When will we get out of it?",
   "ProlChris_11_2": "First we need to find the others. We can't abandon them.",
   "ProlChris_11_3": "I gave a shit about them! I don't want to stay with this cut off. And one of these morons grabbed the keys to the van.",
   "ProlChris_11_4": "Well... Then, apparently, we need to come in.",
   "ProlChris_12": "What crazy people keep this hotel. They couldn't even make normal buttons.",
   "ProlChris_12_1": "I like it, even if it's a little creepy.<br>Anyway, it looks like that's the only one working here.",
   "ProlChris_13": "It's strange, this place looks much bigger. But from the outside the hotel seemed quite compact.",
   "ProlChris_13_1": "Hmm. And what's next? I can't imagine.",
   "ProlChris_13_2": "Are you asking me? ",
   "ProlChris_13_3": "I am going to go there. I'm sure they are there.",
   "ProlChris_13_4": "And you leave me alone? What if there is something here?",
   "ProlChris_13_5": "Yeah, a lot of dust. Fucking dusty monster.",
   "ProlChris_13_6": "I'm sure you'll talk him to death. And I'm getting out of here.",
   "ProlChris_13_7": "Okay. I'm sure this way we have an even better chance of finding Selena.",
   "ProlChris_14":"Well, why the hell should I go there? To inflate my ears even more?",
   "ProlChris_14_1": "Holy crap, this old thing doesn't work again!<br>Oh, shit, looks like it was a mistake to come here.",
   "ProlChris_14_2": "The door is locked.",
   "ProlChris_14_3":"Another locked door.",
   "ProlChris_14_4": "Surprise, surprise, this door is locked.",
   "ProlChris_14_5": "Locked door. How unexpected and pleasant.",
   "ProlChris_14_6": "You guessed wrong - closed. Will you try again?",
   "ProlChris_14_7": "Sorry, but the open door is in other hotels.",
   "ProlChris_14_8": "There may be locked doors here. And this is one of them.",
   "ProlChris_15": "Crap! I'm going to die here myself! We need to get out of here urgently.",
   "ProlChris_16": "Holy crap, where is the elevator!? Where is it!? This damn piece of junk should be here. Fucking hotel, it's also dark as hell!",
   "ProlChris_16_1": "Okay, calm down. I need to feel the wall until my little ones get used to it. Otherwise I'll miss something important.",
   "ProlChris_16_2": "Well, finally, motherfucker! Let's get out of here immediately. I don't want to die in some shitty abandoned hotel.",
   "ProlChris_16_3": "What the hell! I don't remember the corridor swaying like that.<br>I couldn't get lost!",
   "ProlChris_17": "Fuck, fuck, fuck!",
   "ProlChris_17_1": "Bitch! Hurry, bitch, where is the exit?",
   "ProlChris_17_2": "Shit, get away from me! Take your hands off! Go away, you scum!",
   "ProlChris_17_3": "Get away, bitch! Don't come closer!",
   "ProlChris_18": "You press the call button. Then again. And again.<br>Suddenly, a brilliant idea strikes you. There is no electricity in the abandoned building.<br>Experiencing slight shame, you move away from the elevator.",
   "ProlChris_19": "An old sofa. Its leather surface was worn out in several places and covered with cracks.",
   "ProlChris_19_1": "A painting of the Appalachian Mountains. Beneath it is a sign that reads: “A gift to the boarding house from the Grimswater family”.",
   "ProlChris_19_2": "Collection of reproductions of paintings, starting with the avant-garde of the 20s.",
   "ProlChris_19_3": "Tattered furniture. Nothing remarkable.",
   "ProlChris_19_4": "Dinner table and chairs. Not of interest.",
   "ProlChris_19_5": "An exquisite carved counter. Perhaps once on its surface there were glasses with the best wines and highballs with cocktails.<br>But now you can only find dirty round spots here.",
   "ProlChris_19_6": "Dirty bar counter.",

   "ProlClarissa_2_1": "No! I urgently need to run!",
   "ProlClarissa_3": "Urgently! We urgently need to prop the door with something! Oh my God!",
   "ProlClarissa_3_1": "There's no way I'm going out to... to.... To this!<br>We need to urgently do something before it comes here on its own.",
   "ProlClarissa_4": "Here! Th-this should help. At least I hope so.<br>Now I need to look around and understand where I've gotten myself.",
   "ProlClarissa_4_1": "Or maybe I'll find something to protect myself from this ugly thing.<br>If she comes back.",

   "ProlClarissa_4_4": "Well, no! I miraculously survived it, and I'm not going to risk going there again.",
   "ProlClarissa_5": "No, it can't be, it's impossible, it's simply impossible...<br>I just heard it.<br>I will succeed.",
   "ProlClarissa_5_1": "What a familiar place. Almost like my home.",
   "ProlClarissa_5_2": "No, this is my home. My God, what the hell is going on here!?",
   "ProlClarissa_5_3": "Oh! How is this possible? Everything is like in my room. Furniture, wallpaper, just everything.",
   "ProlClarissa_5_3_1": "I hope Selena is okay and she didn’t end up in something like this.",
   "ProlClarissa_5_4": "Hmm. Peroxide, bandages, painkillers. I wouldn't trust all of this, but I still can't find anything better.<br>So this will all be extremely useful. Especially considering this ugly girl with a scissors.",
   "ProlClarissa_5_5": "Exactly my kitchen.<br>Everything is like then...<br>No, nothing happened. Just a misunderstanding.",

   "ProlClarissa_5_6": "Where is this here from? Devilishness, devilishness. How so?<br>But...<br>It seems like I have no choice, I have to take it. If it...it...is still there.<br> It's better than nothing at all.",
   "ProlClarissa_5_7": "Oh God, God, what have I done!<br>I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to! It's an accident, it's his own fault!<br>No, calm down.<br>Deep breath, exhale.<br> Relax, concentrate.<br>Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine.

   "ProlClarissa_6_1":"...<br>It's no use, I can only move forward. I have to cope. I can handle everything.",
   "ProlClarissa_6_2": "This can't be a coincidence anymore. This place is mocking me.<br>Why? What does it want? How did it know about everything? I don't understand.",

   "ProlClarissa_7": "I did it? I can't believe it!<br>I don't know how, but I did it.<br>But this is not the end. I'm still locked here.",

   "ProlClarissa_10": "Wow! What kind of place is this? So cozy.<br>I feel safe here. It's like I can catch my breath.<br>It looks like I managed to escape from that nightmare place.",
   "ProlClarissa_10_1": "The money you found is a strange eclecticism. Each of the coins is unique. Animals, numbers, foreign words and portraits are intertwined on their surface. As if someone collected money from all continents, mixed it together, and then cast it again.",
   "ProlClarissa_10_2": "What strange coins. I think I even saw a vending machine here. I wouldn't be surprised if they fit.",
   "ProlClarissa_10_2_1":"Coffee would come in handy now. Where can I make it?",
   "ProlClarissa_10_3": "Well, it looks like it's time to go back and look for the others.<br> I wonder where this time will take me?",

The bird is bad, everything rushes about, rushes about, no answer to find. I decided to help you, so that you were able to fly away to your flock as quickly as possible. Support will be provided by my faithful assistant, an old friend from the old days.",

   "ProlJeffrey_2_2": "Total questions. No answers, just guesses<br>Hmm. But the thing in his hands might come in handy. I'll take it for myself, just in case.",
   "ProlJeffrey_2_3": "Loaded with combat. One big mystery.<br>Hmm. Perhaps Howard is on the second floor? We should go look there.",
   "ProlJeffrey_3": "Nooo, no longer a coincidence. Something is definitely going on here.",
   "ProlJeffrey_3_1": "Really, dummy? It can't be. Nonsense.<br>Hmm. But then how to explain last time?",
   "ProlJeffrey_3_2":"Hey! Who's there!?<br>Enough of these stupid jokes!",
   "ProlJeffrey_3_3": "In the name of everything! What are you!?",
   "ProlJeffrey_3_4":"Blood? That's it! Looks like this should help.",
   "ProlJeffrey_3_5": "It looks like this beast has frozen. What's wrong with it?<br>It doesn't matter. Shoot it immediately, kill it.",
   "ProlJeffrey_4_0":"A riddled mannequin lies at your feet. The young man's once pleasant face is now covered with bullet holes. And the sleek red suit has unpleasant holes here and there. But despite your wounds, something in the back of your mind whispers that this will not be your last encounter. Shaking off these thoughts, you continue on your way.",
   "ProlJeffrey_4": "Unbelievable! The creature is dead. Whatever it is.",

   "ProlJeffrey_6_0": "The entrance is blocked by a massive wooden box.",
   "ProlJeffrey_6_1": "What's wrong with him? Usually he's obedient.<br>We need to catch up. This place is too dangerous, unpredictable.",

   "ProlJeffrey_6_15": "We act according to the rules of this place. Everything is at hand.<br>So, where are the tools here?",

   "ProlJeffrey_6_20": "The sizzling anger and rage bubbling in the chest darkens the eyes.<br>The hatred is so strong that the mind turns off for a moment, allowing aggression to take over.",

   "Location_06_01": "The elevator doors reveal a picture of total chaos. The wallpaper is torn and hanging in tatters. Claws have been sharpened on the Weinscots... Many, many times. And the carpets look more like a tattered tatter. You notice a trail of blood stretching across the floor.",

   "Actor1_06_Conrad_15": "Blah blah blah. Certainly.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad_01": "You're in luck. Just a little more and…",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad_02": "Ugh... Thanks. So, how about you?",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad_03": "Jeffrey.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad_04": "Despite the circumstances, it's nice to meet you. Conrad.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad_05": "Mutually.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad_06": "But what are you doing here?",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad_07": "I can ask you the same thing.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad_08": "Decided to climb with a friend. A little weekend adventure in an infamous place in the city. Here's how it turned out...",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad_09": "I understand.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad_10": "Listen, I have a key here. I wanted to escape the creatures, and locked the door behind me. As you understand, I'm not a walker. get out of here.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad_11": "Interesting. Thank you, but I won't promise anything.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad_12": "Well, at least something. See you later.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad_01": "Terrible and so beautiful. Such a rich ruby blood color…",    
   "Actor5_06_Conrad_02": "Um, do you think it's a good idea to say that to the first person you meet? I understand you saved my life, and I'm grateful, but still...",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad_03": "Ripe cherries, this color is perfect for depicting ripe cherries. Don't you think so?",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad_04": "Yeah. By the way, my name is Conrad.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad_05": "Selena.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad_06": "What a touching and moving meeting. And what did such a peculiar person forget in such an equally peculiar place?",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad_07": "I can't remember, maybe it was all a dream. And all these horrors are incredible, dizzying events, all this is just a figment of my imagination.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad_08":"Amazing. Look, I was running here while I locked the door behind me. And I still have the key. I suggest joining forces. You go and see what's there, and when you get back, we'll decide what to do next.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad_09": "Great tactician, genius, and strategist. I accept your offer and set out immediately.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad_10": "Great, so see you soon.",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad_01": "Poor thing! Are you okay? Can you move? Is there anything else I can help you with? Can I get you something?",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad_02": "Hush, honey. It's okay. Who are you anyway?",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad_03": "My name is Clarissa. I'm stuck in a hotel here. And you seem to be too. Who could do this? Who attacked you? Are they still here?",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad_04": "Be quiet!",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad_05": "Sorry!",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad_06": "Not so fast. Let's go in order. My name is Conrad, and I'm also locked in here. Some dogs attacked me. And they're definitely here, but not in this room. I locked the door behind me." ,
   "Actor6_06_Conrad_07": "Oh, you're so brave, you remind me of my older brother who...",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad_08": "Listen! I still have the key to the door. Here's what: let's go see what's in that room, and when you get back, we'll think about what to do next.",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad_09":"Of course! It's just me! Except, those dogs, are they still there?",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad_10":"That's what you're about to find out. Come on, hurry up, I believe in you.",
   "Actor1_06_Conrad2_01":"Shit, what the fuck are you doing!? Decided to fucking kill me here!?",
   "Actor1_06_Conrad2_02": "Hey! I told you right away that there are a lot of dogs here!",
   "Actor1_06_Conrad2_03": "Yes, 4 things jumped out at me at once, damn it! They nearly ripped my ass off! I almost moved my horses there!",
   "Actor1_06_Conrad2_04": "But now we know they're still there, don't we?",
   "Actor1_06_Conrad2_05": "Fuckers! May I fall for your bullshit one more time!",
   "Actor1_06_Conrad2_06": "Calm down! Better think about what to do next?",
   "Actor1_06_Conrad2_07": "Personally, I'm going to find out where the exit is. And you can at least die. I don't give a fuck.",
   "Actor1_06_Conrad2_08": "So... So you just leave me here?",
   "Actor1_06_Conrad2_09": "He said fuck it. Arevedrochi or whatever.",
   "Actor1_06_Conrad2_10": "Wait a minute!",
   "Actor1_06_Conrad2_11": "…",    
   "Actor1_06_Conrad2_12": "(I want to discuss something else with this moron. It's better to poke around in other western rooms)",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_01": "Mate! You're back, what's the news?",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_02": "Terrible, that was terrible.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_03": "Is there more danger than I thought?",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_04": "Poor, how... How could I do this to them?",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_05": "So what happened? Are there many of them?",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_06": "Beast, bastard, killer, bastard…",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_07": "Hey, are you okay?",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_08": "(Get a grip, calm down) <br>Yes. There are a lot of them, all wild or feral. Probably more.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_09": "So, what should we do? How do we get out of here? Should we kill the leader?",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_10": "Yes. Get rid of the leader. Good option.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_11": "Can I rely on you? I'm sorry, but I can't help you, you can see my condition.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_12": "Difficult. Very difficult. Ordeal.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_13": "I believe in you, mate. I think the leader should be in the other rooms - the ones in the west.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_14": "Unbearable. But no choice. Looks like the only option.",
   "Actor2_06_Conrad2_15": "Well, good luck to you. You know I'll be here.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad2_01":"Here's our extravagant lady. Did you find anything?",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad2_02": "Incredible cruelty. Primal, indomitable. A real animal kingdom with its angry and predatory inhabitants.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad2_03": "Awesome. I can see you're still leveling up. And it looks like the problem hasn't gone away and the dogs are still there.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad2_04": "Unfortunate and lost souls who need to be saved.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad2_05":"Yeah, that's right. I completely agree with you. Apparently, they can only be saved by sending them to the next world.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad2_06":"Cruelty begets cruelty. There is only one way - to prove the right of the strong, to rise above the local fauna.",    
   "Actor5_06_Conrad2_07": "Hmmm. Looks like the only way to do that is to deal with the leader of the pack. I understand he should be somewhere in the western rooms.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad2_08":"The sword protects us from troubles, courage is our stronghold. Where you are destined to die, death will find you. I will not compromise my honor to prolong my life. The enemy attack should only amuse us.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad2_09": "Um... Yes... Ah, I can't share this feat with you. You can see my condition yourself.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad2_10":"Well, I can take you as a banner. An inspiring canvas with no apparent practical use.",
   "Actor5_06_Conrad2_11": "I'm sorry, but I really can't do anything. I'd rather just be here. And good luck, I trust you will succeed.",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad2_01": "Oh my God! You have no idea what happened there! I went into this room, and how it started there! These wild dogs climbed right from everywhere, they're all just scary, but I'm like…",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad2_02": "It's started... Calm down! Breathe deeply, calmly tell me what happened there.",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad2_03": "Dogs, lots and lots, and all of them are fierce like in our town with Uncle Mitchell, who sometimes let him out of the yard ...",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad2_04": "Don't get distracted!",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad2_05":"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Anyway, they attacked me, and I started to fight them off, and I managed somehow. But, in general, there was nothing significant. Well, except for those dogs.",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad2_06": "Sooooo. The news is disappointing. Looks like we're not going to get out that easily. Hey, can you help me one more time? I'm sure such a brave and beautiful girl can handle anything.",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad2_07": "Oh! You flatter me! What can I do?",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad2_08": "Looks like we need to deal with the leader of the pack. But as you can see, I'm not a walker, and I'm not a fighter. So this important task falls on your bolt... I mean on your shoulders.",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad2_09": "Wow! Do you really think I can do it!?",
   "Actor6_06_Conrad2_10": "Sure, honey. Now go ahead and keep exploring the western rooms!",
   "Actor1_07_01":"Did that statue just look at me?!",
   "Actor1_07_02":"Fuck! What the hell are you?!",
   "Actor1_07_03":"It's trying to kill me!!!",
   "Actor1_07_04":"I'm just stoned, this is a glitch!",
   "Actor1_07_05":"We need to get out of here quickly!",
   "Actor1_07_06":"Shit hotel, he's playing with me!",
   "Actor2_07_01":"What do these statues have inside? I would study them.",
   "Actor2_07_02":"Whatever it is, does it need help?",
   "Actor2_07_03":"There's definitely no corgi here...",
   "Actor2_07_04":"There's blood everywhere... Don't get your robe dirty.",
   "Actor2_07_05":"While I'm looking for a way out, the poor corgi is dying...",
   "Actor2_07_06":"I can do it, my father will be proud of me...",
   "Actor5_07_01":"These statues are beautiful, can you take them with you?",
   "Actor5_07_02":"This creature must be very lonely…",
   "Actor5_07_03":"Ugh, what a mess on the walls, is that blood?",
   "Actor5_07_04":"Hotel designer should just be shot.",
   "Actor5_07_05":"The world is so full of suffering...",
   "Actor5_07_06":"I have to get out of here quickly.",
   "Actor6_07_01":"Will you be able to get the torch out of the statue.. Hardly.",
   "Actor6_07_02":"I'll deal with this creature in no time!",
   "Actor6_07_03":"God, so much blood!",
   "Actor6_07_04":"The mirror! And what a beauty is in it! Me!",
   "Actor6_07_05":"What steps.. It's from the hallway, I'll check it out.",
   "Actor6_07_06":"No one can help me but myself!",
   "Actor1_08_01": "Fuck. Is this still a hotel? Looks like a castle of some kind!",
   "Actor1_08_02": "Shit! Where am I?!",
   "Actor1_08_03": "Who the hell are you?! I'll fuck you up in no time!",
   "Actor1_08_04": "Mmm what a chick. Looks like I'm going to her",
   "Actor1_08_05": "Get off you, there are no vampires!",
   "Actor1_08_06": "Okay, I've got the key, it's time to go.",
   "Actor2_08_01":"It feels like I'm in the Middle Ages.",
   "Actor2_08_02": "What a headache... Where am I?!",
   "Actor2_08_03": "Oh, take it easy. I didn't do anything to you!",
   "Actor2_08_04": "I'll follow that beauty.",
   "Actor2_08_05":"Never believed in them, and here are those times!",
   "Actor2_08_06": "This key will help you escape, great!",
   "Actor5_08_01": "How dark it is here, but how wonderful!",
   "Actor5_08_02": "God, where did I go? What cage is that?!",
   "Actor5_08_03": "If don't look at the face, there is style in his image.",
   "Actor5_08_04": "Who is this girl? I'll follow her.",
   "Actor5_08_05": "I've only seen vampires in movies!",
   "Actor5_08_06": "Great, I have the key, I need to get out.",
   "Actor6_08_01": "What a strange place... Am I still in Europe?",
   "Actor6_08_02": "Okay, we need to get out of this cage.",
   "Actor6_08_03": "Even I won't be able to handle him.",
   "Actor6_08_04": "This girl might know what's going on here.",
   "Actor6_08_05": "If I had a stake, I'd show them.",
   "Actor6_08_06": "I've been through a lot for this key!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_01": "Wow, what is such a pretty girl doing in a place like this?",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_02": "Hans, your father wants you dead. I have to save you!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_03": "What the fuck Hans?! I'm Chris!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_04": "Dear Hans. What to do, your father will kill you!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_05": "I'm not Hans! What does your old man want from me?!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_06": "The key is exactly the key. Father's key, it will help you...",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_07": "Key? Is that all? I can handle it.",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_08": "And I'll be back for you, chick.",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_09": "Oh, Hans, hurry up, father and sister are somewhere nearby!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_10": "I told you I'd be back!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_11": "Hans, do you have the key?",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_12": "Yes, we should get out of this place.",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_01": "I hope you're not with that crazy man with a sword?",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_02": "Hans, my soul, I'm so glad you're alive!",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_03": "Hans? Me? You're absolutely wrong, I'm Geoffrey.",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_04": "You need to hurry, honey. Your father will kill you if he catches you.",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_05": "What did I even do to your father?!",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_06": "The key is in his bedroom, Hans. Take it and go, may my love keep you!",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_07": "Love?! We've never even met before!",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_08": "Okay, we'll deal with that later, key first.",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_10": "Yes, my dear Hans, it really is him!",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_11": "Come on, we can't stay here anymore!",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_12": "Okay, but be careful Hans. Father and sister will try to stop us.",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_01": "Who are you? Will you help me?",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_02": "My dear Hans, I'll help you escape.",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_03": "Hans?! I'm a girl, you must have confused me with someone else.",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_04": "Don't talk nonsense, dear. I won't confuse you with anyone.",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_05": "Father has a key, he keeps it in the bedroom.",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_06": "Key? Will it help? Thank you!",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_07": "Hurry Hans, they'll get you!",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_08": "Madam, are you okay? I can help you get out of this place.",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_09": "They'll try to stop us, Hans. My father and Marta. They're not human anymore...",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_10": "We can do it together. We're stronger than they think.",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_01": "Thanks for your help mate! If it wasn't for you...",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_02": "Hans, I'm glad you're alive!",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_03": "Hans? I'm Clarissa. Are you all right?",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_04": "Oh Hans, you need to hurry, your father is looking for you.",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_05": "What's wrong with you?!",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_06": "Darling, the key you need is in your father's bedroom, take it and run.",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_07": "Key? Thanks for your help mate. Probably.",    
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_08": "Hans... Take care of yourself.",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_09": "Girl, I came back for you!",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_10": "What are you doing, Hans? Run and don't look back!",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_11": "So I will. But I won't leave you here alone.",
   "Location_09_01": "Fire is scorchingly real. If you bring a piece of wood, it will light up at the same second.",
   "Actor1_09_01": "Fuck! Shit is everywhere in here! Fucking floor of a fucking hotel…",
   "Actor1_09_02": "Shit. Reminds me of bars after our show. Only a couple of drunken dudes are missing in the cut",
   "Actor1_09_03": "Who thought of bringing the teacher's desk in here? Hmph, reminds me of my mother, always disappeared at school.",
   "Actor1_09_04":"Haha! The punks know how to have fun. Although a human face for a hot potato is a bit... harsh.",
   "Actor1_09_05": "Shit. The idiot who drew this clearly has a head problem.",
   "Actor1_09_06": "Amazing, damn it! Now the bed is yelling like a woman. Not a hotel, but complete fucked up…",
   "Actor1_09_07": "Fuck. Two smokers in a car. How the fuck is that possible!? Here! In a hotel! And why can't I get this out of my head!?",
   "Actor2_09_01":"It's amazing. Even animals don't defecate where they live. Although the person who left this trail is probably not far from the animals.",
   "Actor2_09_02": "Empty jars, wrappers and leftovers. The person who lives here is obviously not starving. But where does he get all this from? Maybe they feed him? Hah, good boy, hold the bone.",
   "Actor2_09_03": "How strange, the teacher's desk is in the Hotel. Hmmm... I got my first patient at school, Mr. Rodent. He was buried the very next day.",
   "Actor2_09_04":"Children. They play with a human face. Extremely curious. And what smooth edges, a professional surgeon obviously worked.",
   "Actor2_09_05": "Scenes of cruelty and violence, just like the original. Although if people were animals instead... Brrr.",    
   "Actor2_09_06": "It seems like you can hear the screams of a woman in this place. This hotel will always find something to surprise you. Maybe it's just boring?",
   "Actor2_09_07": "Just look. A burned-out car with two dead people in it. And for some reason I can't calmly look at it. There's so much unpleasant and important in it.",
   "Actor5_09_01": "Disgusting, the whole hall is filthy, what kind of pig lives here?",
   "Actor5_09_02": "Remnants of a great feast. I never would have thought that canned food could be opened this way.",
   "Actor5_09_03":"It's strange to see a teacher's table in a hotel. Yeah, as I remember now: <Selena, you're always in your drawings! You better get ready for class!>",
   "Actor5_09_04": "What an abomination! I really hope that the face is rubber, and it's all some kind of joke. Although the scene itself is not without grotesque beauty. Maybe Dali?",
   "Actor5_09_05":"Amazing. Beautiful technique. Capturing people's suffering so accurately. And your own.",
   "Actor5_09_06": "Is this... Is it a woman's screams or am I imagining it?",
   "Actor5_09_07": "Where is the burnt car from? And so familiar. I once saw a similar incident on the highway. But now, I feel such pain and bitterness. And the need to remember what I saw.",
   "Actor6_09_01":"What an abomination! Who could come up with the idea of going to the toilet in the corner like that!?",
   "Actor6_09_02": "A mess! Some people have never heard of sanitation!",
   "Actor6_09_03": "Wow! The teacher's table! Eh... We lacked so much in those years. The skin still itches from that cheap lousy uniform from the flea market.",
   "Actor6_09_04": "God! What a nightmare! Where are the kids from and why are they playing with human faces!? This hotel is a living hell...",
   "Actor6_09_05": "Terrible art! The painter should have exercised more. It helps keep the mind clear.",
   "Actor6_09_06":"Well, it looks like someone is screaming. Poor thing, I hope she's okay...",
   "Actor6_09_07": "This... This is simply monstrous! I'm about to be destroyed by negative emotions! But I just can't get it out of my head, I have to remember it…",

   "Actor1_12_03_13": "E-what happened just now!? Holy shit.",
   "Actor1_12_03_14": "This hit me, almost like that time in the club.",
   "Actor1_12_03_15": "But for me to carry fucking children in my arms, ugh.",
   "Actor1_12_03_16": "Okay, I have the key, it's time to give the slippers.",
   "Actor1_12_03_17": "And her creepy face can be used for the cover, hmmm...",
   "Actor1_12_03_18": "Oh, you little bitch!",
   "Actor1_12_03_19": "Fuck!",
   "Actor1_12_03_20": "Right in my beautiful face!",
   "Actor1_12_03_21": "Fucking children! I hate them.",
   "Actor1_12_03_22": "It's time to get out. I hope this key isn't just another scam from the local devils.",
   "Actor1_12_03_23": "You stupid little bitch. Rot in hell.",
   "Actor1_12_03_24": "Well, why the hell should I go there? I didn't volunteer to be the nanny of stupid brats.",
   "Actor1_12_04": "Holy crap, what kind of stuffed animal is this?",
   "Actor1_12_04_1": "Damn it! Where did you come from such a freak?",
   "Actor1_12_04_2": "Holy crap, I failed him!",
   "Actor1_12_04_3": "Who's the coolest here!?",
   "Actor1_12_04_4": "I'm the coolest! Oh yes.",
   "Actor1_12_05": "The door is closed again? Also in chains.",
   "Actor1_12_05_1": "Damn inventors.",
   "Actor1_12_05_2": "Couldn't you come up with something more interesting?",
   "Actor1_12_05_3": "Blah, look for the key again.",
   "Actor1_12_05_4": "Fuck, again a rhymer and a daub.",
   "Actor1_12_05_5": "The text is complete crap, mine is a hundred times cooler.",
   "Actor1_12_05_6": "So, let's see what happened to the pigs.",
   "Actor1_12_05_7": "Holy crap! This is a massacre.",
   "Actor1_12_05_8": "The disgusting pigs got theirs.",
   "Actor1_12_05_9": "Heh. And this fucking hotel can be a pleasant surprise.",
   "Actor1_12_05_10":"...",
   "Actor1_12_05_11": "So, what should I do with them?",
   "Actor1_12_05_12": "Yeah, twice. If only they would let me out so easily.",
   "Actor1_12_05_13": "Let's look in your pockets. Maybe there will be something.",
   "Actor1_12_05_14_0": "Having searched the pockets, we can only find a badge with the name Kurt Garrish.",
   "Actor1_12_05_15":"Useless garbage.",
   "Actor1_12_05_16": "Well, let's gut the pig.",
   "Actor1_12_05_17_0": "Your find is a small empty flask that reeks of alcohol.",
   "Actor1_12_05_18": "Total bullshit.",
   "Actor1_12_05_19": "Eh. I wish I could knock it over now...",
   "Actor1_12_05_20": "So maybe you will have a key?",
   "Actor1_12_05_21_0":"A few hard coins become yours.",
   "Actor1_12_05_22": "Oh! But this is good.",
   "Actor1_12_05_23": "Nothing sensible.",
   "Actor1_12_05_24": "Key, key, key. Damn pissing key.",
   "Actor1_12_05_25_0": "All that can be found is a cigarette case. The last cigarette is stored inside.",
   "Actor1_12_05_26": "Oops. A valuable find. I'll leave it for later.",
   "Actor1_12_05_27": "Nothing more. I cleaned out all my pockets.",
   "Actor1_12_05_28": "Well, come on already! I hesitated to fumble around.",
   "Actor1_12_05_29_0": "Another brutally murdered policeman is in front of you. A thick vine, bursting out of the ground, engulfs his neck, apparently causing his death. Apart from a dozen bullet wounds.",
   "Actor1_12_05_30_0": "A thorough search of the body finally yields results. The treasured key falls into your hands.",
   "Actor1_12_05_31": "Finally, damn! Now get out of here urgently.",
   "Actor1_12_05_32": "I have the key. It's time to get out.",
   "Actor1_12_05_33": "Holy shit! That was close. How clever I am.",
   "Actor1_12_05_34": "Damn! Fuck your mother! Filthy trash.",
   "Actor1_12_05_35": "It hurts like that. Shit.",
   "Actor1_12_05_36": "That's it, your mother! I turned this place on a bolt.",
   "Actor1_12_05_37": "They're fucking weaklings, they can't handle me.",
   "Actor1_12_05_38":"Hey pig, I'm talking to you.",
   "Actor1_12_05_39":"...",
   "Actor1_12_05_40": "I'm dead, you bastard. Well, good. We can continue.",
   "Actor1_12_05_41": "Oh, you half-baked pig!",
   "Actor1_12_05_42": "Fuck!",
   "Actor1_12_05_43": "Bitch! May the devils beat you up in hell!",
   "Actor1_12_05_44": "Fuck you.",
   "Actor1_12_05_45": "Well, finally!",
   "Actor1_12_05_46": "And how much more crazy shit do I have in front of me?",
   "Actor1_12_05_47":"Shit.",
   "Actor1_12_05_48": "Well, why the hell should I go there? Nonsense.",
   "Actor1_12_05_49": "If only they had gone to hell.",
   "Actor1_12_06": "Yeah, another masterpiece.",
   "Actor1_12_06_1": "How many of them are there anyway?",
   "Actor1_12_06_2": "Some kind of crazy exhibition, not a hotel.",
   "Actor1_12_06_3": "Okay, let's see what's there.",
   "Actor1_12_06_4": "So, it's already clear what to do. And where is he?",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_01": "A tall glass display case containing an Indian costume.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_02": "According to the description, this is the traditional men's clothing of the Abenaki tribe.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_03":"This artifact of a long-past era is of no use to you.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_04": "A massive oak table. Piles of papers, a telephone, a lamp, a mini-file cabinet and other things.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_05": "Literally every centimeter of the table is occupied with something. It looks like the person sitting here was a big shot.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_06":"After rummaging around in the boxes for a while, you find something useful.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_07":"Businessman's gutted desk.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_08": "A locked safe, possibly containing valuables. Or some kind of horror waiting for you to turn your back?",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_09": "The longer you look at him, the more colorful and disturbing pictures your imagination draws.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_10": "You move away, not wanting to provoke what's inside.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_11":"Useless mysterious safe.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_12":"Antique bookcase.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_13": "The spines of books are visible on the shelves. Some are clearly older than the furniture containing them.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_14": "Now is not the time to engage in literature.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_15": "Scattered on the table are magazines from the 1940s, dedicated to business, mostly hotels.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_16": "In addition to waste paper - a silver tray, a bottle of whiskey and two glasses.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_17": "Shrugging your shoulders, you decide to wet your throat.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_18": "Wow, it went well. My soul felt better.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_19": "You decide to knock back another glass.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_20": "And one more.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_21": "And one more thing.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_22": "The fifth glass turns out to be the last. Both for the contents of the bottle and for you.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_23": "It is not known how long you lay there, but it would be better if this serenity did not end. For, having come to your senses, you feel a monstrous headache and nausea.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_24": "You get a shiver when you look at an empty bottle.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_25":"A door blocking the path again. This time the handle is missing, and the keyhole resembles a coin slot.",
   "Actor1_12_06_5_26": "You can't open it that easily.",
   "Actor1_12_06_6": "Where is he by the fucking leg?",
   "Actor1_12_06_7": "Probably in this fucking safe. Another stupid mockery, just to annoy me.",
   "Actor1_12_06_8": "So how do I like those...",
   "Actor1_12_06_9": "W-what happened just now, your mother!?",
   "Actor1_12_06_10": "Stupid kids, dead cops, now this.",
   "Actor1_12_06_11": "Damn, it's not like I can get out of here.",
   "Actor1_12_06_12":"…",
   "Actor1_12_06_13": "Why isn't there some idiot to deal with this for me?",
   "Actor1_12_06_14": "Ugh, fuck! Mother of God!",
   "Actor1_12_06_15": "I think I'm about to puke.",
   "Actor1_12_06_16": "What kind of perversion is this?",
   "Actor1_12_06_17_01": "Entangled in vegetation, a naked fat man hangs from the ceiling. Giblets hang from his torn stomach. His mouth is filled with crumpled bills. Despite the ugly wound, his eyes, pleading, oozing with tears, glare into you.",
   "Actor1_12_06_17_02": "Before you have time to move, a coin falls out of the gutted man's belly with a clang. Following it, others gradually turn into a cash flow. The fat man groans in agony. Finally, a key falls onto the mountain of bloody coins.",
   "Actor1_12_06_18": "Damn it! What kind of schizophrenia is going on here!",
   "Actor1_12_06_19": "Crap! How did they do this to him, who?",
   "Actor1_12_06_20": "And I need to approach this? And also get my hands dirty?",
   "Actor1_12_06_21": "Damn, looks like I have no choice.",
   "Actor1_12_06_22": "Boo! It stinks so much! I'm all covered in this too. Damn it. It's a sore spot. We need to quickly get out of here before they hang us like that.",
   "Actor1_12_06_23_01":"Useless, mutilated body. You don't want to go near it.",
   "Actor1_12_06_24": "Well, finally. This freak is left behind.",
   "Actor1_12_06_25": "I'm so fed up with all this. Where's the bad way out?",
   "Actor1_12_06_26": "No, no, never. I will not go back to this fat guy. We must move on.",
   "Actor1_12_07": "What? Seriously? Freedom!? It can't be!",
   "Actor1_12_07_01": "Holy shit! I wasn't fooled.<br>It's a forest, let's cut it to the roots!",
   "Actor1_12_07_02": "So it turns out that I can finally get out of here?<br>And why am I stuck then?<br>It's time to give me a hard time.",
   "Actor1_12_07_03": "Uh-uh, wasn't there a picture here?",
   "Actor1_12_07_04": "It doesn't matter, the main thing is that you can finally escape.",
   "Actor1_12_07_05": "What a thicket, you'll get through it.",
   "Actor1_12_07_06": "Oh, I remember, my grandmother used to bake pies from blackberries, they were delicious.",
   "Actor1_12_07_07": "We need to look for another way.",
   "Actor1_12_07_08": "What the hell is this, people? Yes, damn it! Luck is always on the side of the coolest.",
   "Actor1_12_07_09": "We stomp to them urgently.",
   "Actor1_12_07_10": "No, no, no, no, I'm in the other direction.",
   "Actor1_12_07_11": "Hey! Dudes! Who the hell are you?",
   "Actor1_12_07_12":"Oh! Another tourist.<br>How unexpected it is to see a stranger here.",
   "Actor1_12_07_13": "Don't even say that! In such and such a wilderness.",
   "Actor1_12_07_14": "Don't stand on the sidelines, come to us.",
   "Actor1_12_07_15": "Damn, don't talk to me about it.<br>I asked who you are.",
   "Actor1_12_07_16": "What a sight you have! Where did you manage to do that?",
   "Actor1_12_07_17": "I'm telling you, he got lost.",
   "Actor1_12_07_18": "Exactly, exactly, look how tattered he is.<br>And the eyes! The eyes! Well, he's definitely lost his way.",
   "Actor1_12_07_19": "Hello! Do you have an ass instead of ears!?<br>Are you listening to me?",
   "Actor1_12_07_20": "We...hee hee...we urgently need to walk him to the car.",
   "Actor1_12_07_21": "Yes, yes! You are a real genius.<br>That's where he will find himself.",
   "Actor1_12_07_22": "Come on, you ragamuffin, don't stand there, follow us!",
   "Actor1_12_07_23": "Hey! Sheep! Who did you call...",
   "Actor1_12_07_24": "Crap! Apparently, we need to follow these idiots.",
   "Actor1_12_07_25":"Hey! Assholes!",
   "Actor1_12_07_26": "Hey! Hello!",
   "Actor1_12_07_27": "Oh no, bitch, not again. Don't say I was fucked.",
   "Actor1_12_07_28": "Fuck! Looks like I lost them. Just this stupid clearing.",
   "Actor1_12_07_29": "All of this really smells like crap. Some kind of bullshit.",
   "Actor1_12_07_30": "And what did I forget there?",
   "Actor1_12_07_31": "Another one? Not a forest, but a passageway.",
   "Actor1_12_07_32": "Hey, you! Are you with them too?",
   "Actor1_12_07_33": "Hello! I'm talking to you.<br>Have you seen the idiots?",
   "Actor1_12_07_34": "They can't take me, they can't take me and they can't take me...",
   "Actor1_12_07_35": "Crap!<br>I knew that all this was complete crap.<br>We need to get out of here urgently.",
   "Actor1_12_07_36":"Fuck, fuck, fuck!",
   "Actor1_12_07_": "I knew it. I knew it was all a moronic circus!<br>I will never leave here.",
   "Actor1_12_07_": "And what is this key?<br>Why did this freak pray to a tree like that?<br>Some kind of crap.",
   "Actor1_12_07_": "I can't believe this is all over!<br>I'm so tired of this crap.<br>I need to get to the elevator quickly.",
   "Actor2_12_01_01":"Как и ожидалось. Крайне любопытное место.<br>Что с ним не так?",
   "Actor2_12_01_02":"Так и знал. Я в ловушке.<br>Придётся искать выход.",
   "Actor2_12_01_03":"Если он вообще есть.",
   "Actor2_12_01_04":"Бедняга Говард, что с тобой случилось?",
   "Actor2_12_01_05":"Надо выбираться отсюда.",
   "Actor2_12_02_01":"Заперто.",
   "Actor2_12_02_02":"Чтобы всё было так просто?<br>Нонсенс.",
   "Actor2_12_02_03":"Нужно искать ключ.",
   "Actor2_12_02_04":"Какое пренебрежительное отношение.",
   "Actor2_12_02_05":"Не то, чтобы меня беспокоила судьба ребёнка…",
   "Actor2_12_02_06":"Но всё же…",
   "Actor2_12_02_07":"Во имя всего! Эй!",
   "Actor2_12_02_08":"Проклятье!",
   "Actor2_12_02_09":"Я в западне. Попался, идиот.",
   "Actor2_12_02_10":"Меня загоняют, как тупое животное.",
   "Actor2_12_02_11":"Выхода нет.",
   "Actor2_12_02_12":"Ребёнок? Подозрительно.<br>Нужно быть начеку.",
   "Actor2_12_02_13":"Ты меня слышишь? Эй!",
   "Actor2_12_02_14":"Никакой реакции.<br>Что с ней?",
   "Actor2_12_02_15":"Во имя всего! От детей одни проблемы.",
   "Actor2_12_02_16":"Что в клинике, что здесь.",
   "Actor2_12_02_17":"В этом месте человеческая жизнь – ничто.",
   "Actor2_12_03":"Э-эй! Прочь! Назад!<br>Я буду защищаться!",
   "Actor2_12_03_01":"Уф… Неужели я ещё на что-то способен?",
   "Actor2_12_03_02":"Защитил себя, но потерял Говарда. ",
   "Actor2_12_03_03":"Мудак.",
   "Actor2_12_04":"Ещё одна? Теперь и в цепях.<br>Я, кажется, начинаю понимать.",
   "Actor2_12_04_01":"Поиски ключа. Вновь.",
   "Actor2_12_04_02":"Одежда, оружие. Похоже на тридцатые.<br>А прошлая? Очевидно конец 19-го века.",
   "Actor2_12_04_03":"Сколько же лет этому отелю?",
   "Actor2_12_04_04":"Неважно. После.<br>Если я правильно понял, то…",
   "Actor2_12_04_05":"Да, так и есть.<br>Не совсем ловушка.",
   "Actor2_12_04_06":"И что же тут?",
   "Actor2_12_04_07":"Во имя всего!",
   "Actor2_12_04_08":"Найти ключ.<br>Не задерживаться.",
   "Actor2_12_04_09":"Не хочу присоединиться к ним.",
   "Actor2_12_04_10":"Не выйти. Конечно же.",
   "Actor2_12_04_11":"Наверняка. Я найду ключ у кого-то из них.",
   "Actor2_12_04_12":"Обыскав карманы, удаётся найти лишь жетон с именем Курт Гарриш.",
   "Actor2_12_04_13":"Ничего.",
   "Actor2_12_04_14":"Множественные пулевые раны.",
   "Actor2_12_04_15":"И рваные.",
   "Actor2_12_04_16":"Такие мог оставить только зверь. И не один.",
   "Actor2_12_04_17":"Но на картине их не было…",
   "Actor2_12_04_18":"Так. Посмотрим, что у тебя.",
   "Actor2_12_04_19":"Ваша находка – небольшая пустая фляга, от которой разит алкоголем.",
   "Actor2_12_04_20":"Мимо.",
   "Actor2_12_04_21":"Что же с ними стало?",
   "Actor2_12_04_22":"Несколько звонких монет становятся вашими.",
   "Actor2_12_04_23":"Растерзанный труп с пустыми карманами.",
   "Actor2_12_04_24":"Должно же быть хоть что-то.",
   "Actor2_12_04_25":"Всё что получается найти – портсигар.<br>Внутри хранится последняя сигарета.",
   "Actor2_12_04_26":"Это может пригодиться.",
   "Actor2_12_04_27":"Никакой пользы.",
   "Actor2_12_04_28":"Во имя всего. Сколько можно?<br>Найду я его, или нет?",
   "Actor2_12_04_29":"Ещё один жестоко убитый полисмен перед вами. Толстая лоза, вырвавшись из земли, охватывает его шею, видимо, став причиной смерти. Если не считать десятка пулевых ранений.",
   "Actor2_12_04_30":"Тщательный обыск тела наконец даёт результат.<br>Заветный ключ попадает к вам в руки.",
   "Actor2_12_04_31":"Потрясающе. Теперь к выходу. Случиться может что угодно.",
   "Actor2_12_04_32":"Не стоит задерживаться.",
   "Actor2_12_04_33":"Проклятье!<br>Все проблемы, всегда только от людей.",
   "Actor2_12_04_34":"Убраться отсюда. Скорее.",
   "Actor2_12_04_35":"Как они могли пролежать там столько?",
   "Actor2_12_04_36":"Почему они не сгнили?",
   "Actor2_12_04_37":"Говард. Ты тоже стал жертвой?",
   "Actor2_12_04_38":"Я не хочу задерживаться здесь.",
   "Actor2_12_05":"Теперь всё ясно. И что надо делать.",
   "Actor2_12_05_01":"Посмотрим, что там.",
   "Actor2_12_05_02":"…",
   "Actor2_12_05_03":"О, я знаю. Полная свобода от этого кошмара.",
   "Actor2_12_05_04":"Я разочарован. Обыденность.",
   "Actor2_12_05_05":"Нужно двигаться дальше.",
   "Actor2_12_05_06":"На столе разбросаны журналы за 1940-й год, посвящённые бизнесу, по большей части отельному.",
   "Actor2_12_05_07":"Кроме макулатуры – серебряный поднос, бутылка виски и два стакана.",
   "Actor2_12_05_08":"Бррр. Меня тошнит от одного вида этой бутылки… ",
   "Actor2_12_05_09":"Бесполезно. Его нигде нет.",
   "Actor2_12_05_10":"Может, если…",
   "Actor2_12_05_11":"Проклятье!",
   "Actor2_12_05_12":"Ч-что это было?",
   "Actor2_12_05_13":"Похоже, ничего.",
   "Actor2_12_05_14":"Надо пойти посмотреть. Другого пути нет.",
   "Actor2_12_05_15":"Ох, во имя всего!",
   "Actor2_12_05_16":"Бесчеловечная жестокость. Хорошо, что это не животное. Было бы невыносимо смотреть.",
   "Actor2_12_05_17":"Он… Неужели он ещё жив?",
   "Actor2_12_05_18":"Нет. Не может всё быть так просто.",
   "Actor2_12_05_19":"Ловушка. Однозначно.",
   "Actor2_12_05_20":"Во имя всего.",
   "Actor2_12_05_21":"Издевательство. Устал.<br>Когда всё это кончится?",
   "Actor2_12_05_22":"Мне нет до него дела.",
   "Actor2_12_05_23":"Нет. Только вперёд.",
   "Actor2_12_06":"Да-да. Конечно.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Надеюсь, это последняя.",
   "Actor2_12_06_02":"Убедительно. Но нет.",
   "Actor2_12_06_03":"Только полный придурок поверит.",

   "Actor2_12_06_07_0":"Ваш путь преграждают густые заросли ежевики под два метра ростом.<br>Попытавшись продраться сквозь них, вы лишь застрянете с сотней острых шипов в теле.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Люди?<br>Судя по речи – вменяемые.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Может, кто-то с концерта?",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Если они вообще выжили. Но надо проверить.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Голоса доносятся не оттуда.",

   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Друзья, друзья. Такая счаст… хи-хи …счастливая встреча.<br>Теперь точно мы сможем найти путь.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Эй, вы слушаете?",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Именно-именно, я считаю, его появление нужно отпраздновать.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"О да. Закатим пирушку! И пусть он поведает о жизни своей.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Какой же я идиот. Повёлся.<br>Очередной бред.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Но надо сходить к машине.<br>Славный гость, давай с нами!",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Верно-верно. Там и повеселимся.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Во имя всего.<br>Чертовщина не заканчивается.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Но они выглядят безобидно.<br>Стоит проследить.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Я там ничего не найду.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Ещё один?",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Нет смысла переживать. Наверное.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Твою мать!",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Дебил, дебил, дебил!",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Какой же я придурок!<br>Позволил себе расслабиться.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Уф. Вдох. Выдох. Всё позади.<br>Я справился. Ключ у меня.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Выход? Поверить не могу.<br>Этот кошмар закончен.",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"Закончен ли?",
   "Actor2_12_06_01":"На какое-то время.",
   "Actor5_12_01":"Нет ничего, никаких волнующих явлений.",
   "Actor5_12_01_01":"А запах. Такой знакомый запах слышу я.",
   "Actor5_12_01_02":"И точно. Здесь живописью пахнет.<br>Подобно мастерской.",
   "Actor5_12_01_03":"Напрасно. Пытаться даже и не стоит. Наверняка не подаст признаков жизни.",
   "Actor5_12_01_04":"Похоже, мне вновь придётся по лабиринтам скитаться.",
   "Actor5_12_01_05":"Оставь надежду, всяк сюда входящий.",
   "Actor5_12_02":"Как до нелепого глупо.",
   "Actor5_12_02_01":"Конечно. Путь открыт.<br>Иди до самого конца, и нет тебе преграды.",
   "Actor5_12_02_02":"Но сначала ключ найди.",
   "Actor5_12_02_03":"Дёргай-не дёргай, а так просто не открыть.",
   "Actor5_12_02_04":"Как интересно.<br>И что за Матиас, нарисовавший это?",
   "Actor5_12_02_05":"Какие хаотичные мазки.<br>Однако, из них выходит цельная картина.",
   "Actor5_12_02_06":"И, кажется, проглядывается нечто большее. Возможно, если я…",
   "Actor5_12_02_07":"Эй! Какого дьявола!?",
   "Actor5_12_02_08":"Проклятье!",
   "Actor5_12_02_09":"Я снова оказалась в западне пространства.",
   "Actor5_12_02_10":"Скитания. Без края и конца.",
   "Actor5_12_02_11":"Посмотрим, что теперь.",
   "Actor5_12_02_12":"Отель с такой лёгкостью меняет окружение. ",
   "Actor5_12_02_13":"Каким же образом?",
   "Actor5_12_02_14":"Что?",
   "Actor5_12_02_15":"Ребёнок? Здесь?",
   "Actor5_12_02_16":"И так похожа на ту, что нарисована снаружи.",
   "Actor5_12_02_17":"Хотя, чему теперь мне удивляться.",
   "Actor5_12_02_18":"Эй! Ты!",
   "Actor5_12_02_19":"Не отвечает.",
   "Actor5_12_02_20":"Но… Я словно слышу её голос в голове.",
   "Actor5_12_02_21":"Дьявол! Эти дети!",
   "Actor5_12_02_22":"Теперь, отчасти, я готова понять Сатурна.",
   "Actor5_12_02_23":"Мёртвый ребёнок.<br>Словно сошедший с тех фотографий прошлого века.",
   "Actor5_12_02_24":"Там всё мертво и безыдейно.",
   "Actor5_12_02_25":"А это ещё кто? Доверия он не внушает.",
   "Actor5_12_02_26":"О, Чёрт!",
   "Actor5_12_02_27":"Ха! Похоже, не зря прошли уроки прошлого.",
   "Actor5_12_02_28":"А я почти что бессмертный рыцарь на коне.",
   "Actor5_12_03":"Заветный проход снова недоступен.",
   "Actor5_12_03_01":"Теперь ещё и цепями скован.",
   "Actor5_12_03_02":"И так всю мою жизнь.",
   "Actor5_12_03_03":"И снова знакомый почерк. Экспрессия, потерянность и злость.",
   "Actor5_12_03_04":"Кто же ты, Матиас? Ещё один заложник местных сил?",
   "Actor5_12_03_05":"Возможно, ответ будет там. Вместе с ключом.",
   "Actor5_12_03_06":"О, дьявол!",
   "Actor5_12_03_07":"Я так и знала, что рано или поздно отель снова покажет свои зубы.",
   "Actor5_12_03_08":"…",
   "Actor5_12_03_09":"Э-это сделала та богомерзкая тварь?",
   "Actor5_12_03_10":"Надо держать ухо востро.",
   "Actor5_12_03_11":"Нет пути. Ну, что же. Хотя бы с тыла мне ничего не угрожает.",
   "Actor5_12_03_12":"Я надеюсь.",
   "Actor5_12_03_13":"Тела-тела. Застывшие манекены.<br>Жертвы местного тирана. И больше ничего.",
   "Actor5_12_03_14":"Неужели моё спасение спрятано у вас?",
   "Actor5_12_03_15":"Обыскав карманы, удаётся найти лишь жетон с именем Курт Гарриш.",
   "Actor5_12_03_16":"Бесполезно.",
   "Actor5_12_03_17":"Давай-ка и тебя проверим.",
   "Actor5_12_03_18":"Ваша находка – небольшая пустая фляга, от которой разит алкоголем.",
   "Actor5_12_03_19":"Пахнет забвением и тяжёлой головой.",
   "Actor5_12_03_20":"А если не повезёт, то и слепотой…",
   "Actor5_12_03_21":"Скопление красных звёзд на теле.<br>А что в карманах?",
   "Actor5_12_03_22":"Несколько звонких монет становятся вашими.",
   "Actor5_12_03_23":"Однако не будет лишним.",
   "Actor5_12_03_24":"Теперь ты точно не переправишься на тот берег.",
   "Actor5_12_03_25":"Шансы растут от раза к разу.",
   "Actor5_12_03_26":"Всё, что получается найти – портсигар. Внутри хранится последняя сигарета.",
   "Actor5_12_03_27":"Сизый дым избавит от тревог.<br>Оставлю на потом. ",
   "Actor5_12_03_28":"Абсолютное ничего.",
   "Actor5_12_03_29":"Уж не в этом ли кармане спрятан мой приз?",
   "Actor5_12_03_30":"Ещё один жестоко убитый полисмен перед вами. Толстая лоза, вырвавшись из земли, охватывает его шею, видимо, став причиной смерти. Если не считать десятка пулевых ранений.",
   "Actor5_12_03_31":"Тщательный обыск тела, наконец, даёт результат. Заветный ключ попадает к вам в руки.",
   "Actor5_12_03_32":"Свершилось!<br>Можно продолжить это дикое путешествие.",
   "Actor5_12_03_33":"Пора двигаться дальше.",
   "Actor5_12_03_34":"Чёрт! Похоже, ставки растут с каждым разом. Но, я ведь не могу проиграть свою жизнь.<br>А что тогда?",
   "Actor5_12_03_35":"Я выбралась из заперти, чтобы снова в ней оказаться.",
   "Actor5_12_03_36":"Расстояние между стенами– вот степень моей свободы.",
   "Actor5_12_03_37":"Что я там найду? Ещё одну смерть?",
   "Actor5_12_04":"О, Матиас. Неужели тебя заставили стать хронистом этого места?",
   "Actor5_12_04_01":"Посмотрим, что за очередной кошмар мне предстоит.",
   "Actor5_12_04_02":"Всего лишь кабинет?<br>Не будь наивной.",
   "Actor5_12_04_03":"Но стоит осмотреть тут всё. И быть готовой.",
   "Actor5_12_04_04":"Возможности уйти нет. Неожиданно, но факт.",
   "Actor5_12_04_05":"Бестолку.<br>И что они хотят? Нестандартного мышления?",
   "Actor5_12_04_06":"Нет ни уродливой книги, ни ключа в ней.",
   "Actor5_12_04_07":"Может, я должна нарисовать ключ?",
   "Actor5_12_04_08":"Так я и думала. Что-то полезное здесь создать самому невозможно.",
   "Actor5_12_04_09":"Ничего не работает. Ничего нет. Я в тупике.<br>И кабинет этот похоже для меня…",
   "Actor5_12_04_10":"О, дьявол! Н-неужто снова он!?",
   "Actor5_12_04_11":"Н-никого?",
   "Actor5_12_04_12":"Мне нужно рискнуть.",
   "Actor5_12_04_13":"О, чёрт!<br>Что… Что же ты такое?",
   "Actor5_12_04_14":"Такое уродливое, но невозможно оторвать глаз.",
   "Actor5_12_04_15":"Туда!? К нему!?",
   "Actor5_12_04_16":"Хоть я видала и не такие мерзкие вещи.",
   "Actor5_12_04_17":"Не говоря уж об участии.",
   "Actor5_12_04_18":"Ну вот, ещё один в моей коллекции.",
   "Actor5_12_04_19":"Хм. А эта хорошая идея. Странные ключи и новые картины.<br>Новая выставка",
   "Actor5_12_04_20":"Дожить бы только до этого момента.",
   "Actor5_12_04_21":"Ну вот. Ещё одни ворота пали.<br>Становится ли сердце этажа ближе?",
   "Actor5_12_04_22":"Зачем?<br>Я не люблю идти назад.",
   "Actor5_12_05":"Бесполезно",
   "Actor5_12_05_01":"Похожий стиль. Но явная обманка.<br>Подражание. Слепое и бесцельное. ",
   "Actor5_12_05_02":"Хотя… Без опыта нелёгкая задача отличить.",
   "Actor5_12_05_03":"А в записке что? Свобода? Ну-ну, проверим.",
   "Actor5_12_05_04":"Вот чёрт! Не обманули?",
   "Actor5_12_05_05":"Нет, поверить не могу. Не сходится.<br>Дальнейшего то требует исследования.",
   "Actor5_12_05_06":"Голоса не в этой стороне.",
   "Actor5_12_05_07":"Я, всё таки, схожу с ума? Мне это слышится.",
   "Actor5_12_05_08":"Нет-нет. Всё это реально.<br>Но кто тогда…?",
   "Actor5_12_05_09":"О, дьявол! Люди!",
   "Actor5_12_05_10":"Да-да! В этом все мы!",
   "Actor5_12_05_11":"Приветствую любительницу ярких красок!<br>Фантаку бесконечного пути.",
   "Actor5_12_05_12":"Настолько ярких, что, хи-хи, в них можно утонуть. А уж про путь!<br>Так много общего у нас.",
   "Actor5_12_05_13":"Эй! Да откуда вы? Только не говорите, что…",
   "Actor5_12_05_14":"Вы знаете, а я тоже люблю рисовать! И мой друг тоже. И друг его друга!<br>Но никто не знает, кто он такой.",
   "Actor5_12_05_15":"Вот это совпадение! А я с собой взял всё, что нужно.<br>А с пятой головой решим и путевую головоломку.",
   "Actor5_12_05_16":"Тогда, чего мы ждём? Наконец, есть цель и смысл. Вперёд!<br>Только вперёд, не оглядываясь назад.",
   "Actor5_12_05_17":"Да!<br>Создадим все вместе этот прекрасный шедевр.",
   "Actor5_12_05_18":"Это какое-то очередное ребячество, срывающееся в откровенный садизм.",
   "Actor5_12_05_19":"Похоже, выбора нет.<br>Придётся подчиняться правилам и следовать за ними.",
   "Actor5_12_05_20":"Человек? Опять? Ну нет. Я не куплюсь на это снова.<br>Придётся искать иной выход.",
   "Actor5_12_05_21":"Мне с ним не по пути.",
   "Actor5_12_05_22":"О, черти! Опять он!?",
   "Actor5_12_05_23":"Ну, что же! Если меня вынуждают, то придётся противостоять!",
   "Actor5_12_05_24":"Ох, черт тебя дери!!",
   "Actor5_12_05_25":"Ха! Ещё одна победа!<br>Какое упоение, какой азарт.",
   "Actor5_12_05_26":"И пополнение коллекции ключей.",
   "Actor5_12_05_27":"О! Неужели?",
   "Actor5_12_05_28":"Похоже, мой невидимый Вергилий всё же вывел меня из этого круга.",
   "Actor5_12_05_29":"Видимо, лишь для того, чтобы я попала на следующий.",
   "Actor6_12_01":"Ну и ну! Всё выглядит довольно нормально.",
   "Actor6_12_01_01":"Может, даже и не случится ничего плохого.",
   "Actor6_12_01_02":"Надо бы осмотреться тут.",
   "Actor6_12_01_03":"А что, если…",
   "Actor6_12_01_04":"Уверена: надо ещё немного подождать.",
   "Actor6_12_01_05":"Похоже, так просто не получится.",
   "Actor6_12_01_06":"Это ничего! Так даже веселее.",
   "Actor6_12_01_07":"Учитывая, где я оказалась.",
   "Actor6_12_01_08":"Не думаю, что лифт приедет.",
   "Actor6_12_02":"Божечки! Закрыто…",
   "Actor6_12_02_01":"Но ничего, у меня точно получится найти ключ.",
   "Actor6_12_02_02":"Я уверена, у меня всё получится.",
   "Actor6_12_02_03":"Какая красота! Только почему такая печальная?",
   "Actor6_12_02_04":"И насколько же грубые и злые стихи!",
   "Actor6_12_02_05":"Но что мне…",
   "Actor6_12_02_06":"Ой-ёй! Что произошло?!",
   "Actor6_12_02_07":"Где это я?",
   "Actor6_12_02_08":"Ну, вроде не опасно.",
   "Actor6_12_02_09":"Божечки! А выхода-то и нет.",
   "Actor6_12_02_10":"Ничего не поделать.<br>Придётся побродить тут.",
   "Actor6_12_02_11":"Ой! Здесь ребёнок!",
   "Actor6_12_02_12":"Эй! Малышка! Ты меня слышишь?",
   "Actor6_12_02_13":"Почему ты не отвечаешь? ",
   "Actor6_12_02_14":"Не бойся. Я помогу тебе.",
   "Actor6_12_02_15":"Божечки! что же с тобой случилось?",
   "Actor6_12_02_16":"Бедный ребёнок!<br>Как я могу на него злиться?",
   "Actor6_12_02_17":"Наверное она уже столько натерпелась.",
   "Actor6_12_02_18":"Как кто-то вообще мог поступить с ней так?",
   "Actor6_12_02_19":"Вы молча отворачиваетесь, не в силах смотреть на погибшего ребёнка.",
   "Actor6_12_02_20":"Ой! Ещё кто-то.",
   "Actor6_12_02_21":"Почему!? Почему все здесь такие?<br>Почему они заставляют делать эти чудовищные вещи!?",
   "Actor6_12_02_22":"…",
   "Actor6_12_02_23":"У меня не получится. Я снова всё испорчу. Я…",
   "Actor6_12_02_24":"Нет! Нельзя о таком думать. Только хорошее. Всё получится. Я справлюсь.",
   "Actor6_12_02_25":"Я не хочу возвращаться туда",
   "Actor6_12_03":"Ох! И тут всё закрыто.",
   "Actor6_12_03_01":"Да ещё как, аж цепями перекрутили.",
   "Actor6_12_03_02":"Снова искать ключ.",
   "Actor6_12_03_03":"Божечки!<br>Кому придёт в голову такое рисовать?<br>Все эти убийства, насилие, страх.",
   "Actor6_12_03_04":"Похоже, придётся идти туда.",
   "Actor6_12_03_05":"Если тут всё так же, то…",
   "Actor6_12_03_06":"Получилось!",
   "Actor6_12_03_07":"Так, глянем что тут.",
   "Actor6_12_03_08":"Ой, Боже!",
   "Actor6_12_03_09":"Какой ужас!",
   "Actor6_12_03_10":"Они ведь не настоящие",
   "Actor6_12_03_11":"Это все шутка.",
   "Actor6_12_03_12":"И меня заперли с ними!",
   "Actor6_12_03_13":"Я… Я… Я…",
   "Actor6_12_03_14":"Спокойно. Тихо. Без паники.",
   "Actor6_12_03_15":"Видишь? Ничего нет. ",
   "Actor6_12_03_16":"И никого нет.",
   "Actor6_12_03_17":"Можно возвращаться.",
   "Actor6_12_03_18":"Кроме бедняжек ничего нет.",
   "Actor6_12_03_19":"Они что, хотят чтобы я прикоснулась к ним?",
   "Actor6_12_03_20":"Это… Похоже, мне не отвертеться.<br>И, они ведь не будут кусаться. Надеюсь.",
   "Actor6_12_03_21":"Обыскав карманы, удаётся найти лишь жетон с именем Курт Гарриш.",
   "Actor6_12_03_22":"Фу! Как же мерзко!",
   "Actor6_12_03_23":"Только зря руки испачкала.",
   "Actor6_12_03_24":"Похоже, меня не выпустят, пока я не найду ключ.",
   "Actor6_12_03_25":"Ваша находка – небольшая пустая фляга, от которой разит алкоголем.",
   "Actor6_12_03_26":"И тут ничего.",
   "Actor6_12_03_27":"Прости.",
   "Actor6_12_03_28":"Я лишь надеюсь, они не сильно мучались.",
   "Actor6_12_03_29":"Несколько звонких монет становятся вашими.",
   "Actor6_12_03_30":"Нууууу. Деньги ведь ему не понадобятся, да?",
   "Actor6_12_03_31":"Оставлю его в покое.",
   "Actor6_12_03_32":"Божечки! Сколько это может продолжаться?",
   "Actor6_12_03_33":"Всё что получается найти – портсигар. Внутри хранится последняя сигарета.",
   "Actor6_12_03_34":"Мне не нужна эта гадость.",
   "Actor6_12_03_35":"Ни-че-го-шеньки.",
   "Actor6_12_03_36":"Этому просто нет конца!",
   "Actor6_12_03_37":"Такое придет в голову только извращенцу.",
   "Actor6_12_03_38":"Ещё один жестоко убитый полисмен перед вами. Толстая лоза, вырвавшись из земли, охватывает его шею, видимо, став причиной смерти. Если не считать десятка пулевых ранений.",
   "Actor6_12_03_39":"Тщательный обыск тела, наконец, даёт результат. Заветный ключ попадает к вам в руки.",
   "Actor6_12_03_40":"Получилось! Теперь быстрее отсюда.",
   "Actor6_12_03_41":"Я не хочу задерживаться здесь.",
   "Actor6_12_03_42":"Ой, мама! Они же должны быть мертвы!",
   "Actor6_12_03_43":"Скорее, пока меня не прибили, не надо испытывать судьбу.",
   "Actor6_12_03_44":"Фух! Какое облегчение.<br>Наконец, выбралась.",
   "Actor6_12_03_45":"Но это чувство грязи на руках…",
   "Actor6_12_03_46":"Бррр.",
   "Actor6_12_03_47":"Я НЕ вернусь к ним. И точка.",
   "Actor6_12_03_48":"Пусть покоятся с миром.",
   "Actor6_12_04":"Это что, зачем все эти испытания?",
   "Actor6_12_04_01":"Чего они хотят от меня? И кто эти Они?",
   "Actor6_12_04_02":"Неужели я должна сдать…",
   "Actor6_12_04_03":"Нет уж! Так просто сломить меня у них не выйдет!",
   "Actor6_12_04_04":"Ох!",
   "Actor6_12_04_05":"Тут на удивление спокойно.",
   "Actor6_12_04_06":"Высокая стеклянная витрина, с заключённым в нём индейским костюмом.",
   "Actor6_12_04_07":"Согласно описанию – это традиционная мужская одежда племени Абенаки.",
   "Actor6_12_04_08":"Ух ты! Я же видела то же самое в холле.<br>Интересно, этот настоящий? И к чему он тут?",
   "Actor6_12_04_09":"Этот артефакт давно прошедшей эпохи вам ни к чему.",
   "Actor6_12_04_10":"Ничегошеньки не могу найти.",
   "Actor6_12_04_11":"Хм…",
   "Actor6_12_04_12":"Точно!",
   "Actor6_12_04_13":"Надо просто немного поупражняться.<br>Это всегда помогало лучше думать.",
   "Actor6_12_04_14":"Ну нет. Совсем ничего не пришло!",
   "Actor6_12_04_15":"И как мне теперь…",
   "Actor6_12_04_16":"Божечки!",
   "Actor6_12_04_17":"Не подходи! Оставьте меня в покое!",
   "Actor6_12_04_18":"Никого?",
   "Actor6_12_04_19":"Неужели совсем никого?",
   "Actor6_12_04_20":"О, Господи!",
   "Actor6_12_04_21":"Как…Как же это…",
   "Actor6_12_04_22":"Больные чудовища! Ещё и ключ там!",
   "Actor6_12_04_23":"Снова и снова.",
   "Actor6_12_04_24":"Раз за разом.",
   "Actor6_12_04_25":"Этому просто нет конца!",
   "Actor6_12_04_26":"Вдох-выдох. Спокойно.",
   "Actor6_12_04_27":"Просто прикроем глаза и возьмём ключ.<br>Всё получится.",
   "Actor6_12_04_28":"Фу! Он весь в этой дряни!",
   "Actor6_12_04_29":"Но, хотя бы, он у меня.",
   "Actor6_12_04_30":"Божечки! Наконец, это позади.",
   "Actor6_12_04_31":"Но что же дальше?",
   "Actor6_12_04_32":"Я НЕ буду возвращаться туда! Нет!",
   "Actor6_12_05":"Ну конечно! Прям таки свобода!",
   "Actor6_12_05_01":"Наверняка там что-то злющее будет.",
   "Actor6_12_05_02":"Хотя, что мне терять?",
   "Actor6_12_05_03":"Божечки! Как всё натурально.",
   "Actor6_12_05_04":"А этот запах. Настоящий лес!",
   "Actor6_12_05_05":"Ну нет уж. В это очень просто  поверить.<br>Но меня не проведёшь.",
   "Actor6_12_05_06":"Ой! Кажется, тут дверь должна была быть.",
   "Actor6_12_05_07":"И опять эти дурацкие растения.",
   "Actor6_12_05_08":"Ничего себе! Похоже, настоящие люди!",
   "Actor6_12_05_09":"Но… Это не может быть правдой… ",
   "Actor6_12_05_10":"Я видела что за гадости тут происходят.",
   "Actor6_12_05_11":"Только если ребята с концерта.",
   "Actor6_12_05_12":"Мне, всё-таки, лучше проверить.",
   "Actor6_12_05_13":"Ух ты! Не может быть!<br>Вы и правда живые! ",
   "Actor6_12_05_14":"Вы не представляете, КАК я рада вас встретить.<br>Неужели вы тоже тут оказались?<br>Давно ли вы? И что…",
   "Actor6_12_05_15":"Ого! Вы только гляньте, болтушка-хохотушка заглянула к нам на огонёк.",
