   "Actor1_07_01":"Did that statue just look at me?!",
   "Actor1_07_02":"Fuck! What the hell are you?!",
   "Actor1_07_03":"It's trying to kill me!!!",
   "Actor1_07_04":"I'm just stoned, this is a glitch!",
   "Actor1_07_05":"We need to get out of here quickly!",
   "Actor1_07_06":"Shit hotel, he's playing with me!",
   "Actor2_07_01":"What do these statues have inside? I would study them.",
   "Actor2_07_02":"Whatever it is, does it need help?",
   "Actor2_07_03":"There's definitely no corgi here...",
   "Actor2_07_04":"There's blood everywhere... Don't get your robe dirty.",
   "Actor2_07_05":"While I'm looking for a way out, the poor corgi is dying...",
   "Actor2_07_06":"I can do it, my father will be proud of me...",
   "Actor5_07_01":"These statues are beautiful, can you take them with you?",
   "Actor5_07_02":"This creature must be very lonely…",
   "Actor5_07_03":"Ugh, what a mess on the walls, is that blood?",
   "Actor5_07_04":"Hotel designer should just be shot.",
   "Actor5_07_05":"The world is so full of suffering...",
   "Actor5_07_06":"I have to get out of here quickly.",
   "Actor6_07_01":"Will you be able to get the torch out of the statue.. Hardly.",
   "Actor6_07_02":"I'll deal with this creature in no time!",
   "Actor6_07_03":"God, so much blood!",
   "Actor6_07_04":"The mirror! And what a beauty is in it! Me!",
   "Actor6_07_05":"What steps.. It's from the hallway, I'll check it out.",
   "Actor6_07_06":"No one can help me but myself!",
   "Actor1_08_01": "Fuck. Is this still a hotel? Looks like a castle of some kind!",
   "Actor1_08_02": "Shit! Where am I?!",
   "Actor1_08_03": "Who the hell are you?! I'll fuck you up in no time!",
   "Actor1_08_04": "Mmm what a chick. Looks like I'm going to her",
   "Actor1_08_05": "Get off you, there are no vampires!",
   "Actor1_08_06": "Okay, I've got the key, it's time to go.",
   "Actor2_08_01":"It feels like I'm in the Middle Ages.",
   "Actor2_08_02": "What a headache... Where am I?!",
   "Actor2_08_03": "Oh, take it easy. I didn't do anything to you!",
   "Actor2_08_04": "I'll follow that beauty.",
   "Actor2_08_05":"Never believed in them, and here are those times!",
   "Actor2_08_06": "This key will help you escape, great!",
   "Actor5_08_01": "How dark it is here, but how wonderful!",
   "Actor5_08_02": "God, where did I go? What cage is that?!",
   "Actor5_08_03": "He's handsome, who is he?",
   "Actor5_08_04": "Who is this girl? I'll follow her.",
   "Actor5_08_05": "I've only seen vampires in movies!",
   "Actor5_08_06": "Great, I have the key, I need to get out.",
   "Actor6_08_01": "What a strange place... Am I still in Europe?",
   "Actor6_08_02": "Okay, we need to get out of this cage.",
   "Actor6_08_03": "Even I won't be able to handle him.",
   "Actor6_08_04": "This girl might know what's going on here.",
   "Actor6_08_05": "If I had a stake, I'd show them.",
   "Actor6_08_06": "I've been through a lot for this key!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_01": "Wow, what is such a pretty girl doing in a place like this?",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_02": "Hans, your father wants you dead. I have to save you!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_03": "What the fuck Hans?! I'm Chris!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_04": "Dear Hans. What to do, your father will kill you!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_05": "I'm not Hans! What does your old man want from me?!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_06": "The key is exactly the key. Father's key, it will help you...",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_07": "Key? Is that all? I can handle it.",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_08": "And I'll be back for you, chick.",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_09": "Oh, Hans, hurry up, father and sister are somewhere nearby!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_10": "I told you I'd be back!",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_11": "Hans, do you have the key?",
   "Actor1_08_Elsa_12": "Yes, we should get out of this place.",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_01": "I hope you're not with that crazy man with a sword?",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_02": "Hans, my soul, I'm so glad you're alive!",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_03": "Hans? Me? You're absolutely wrong, I'm Geoffrey.",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_04": "You need to hurry, honey. Your father will kill you if he catches you.",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_05": "What did I even do to your father?!",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_06": "The key is in his bedroom, Hans. Take it and go, may my love keep you!",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_07": "Love?! We've never even met before!",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_08": "Okay, we'll deal with that later, key first.",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_10": "Yes, my dear Hans, it really is him!",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_11": "Come on, we can't stay here anymore!",
   "Actor2_08_Elsa_12": "Okay, but be careful Hans. Father and sister will try to stop us.",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_01": "Who are you? Will you help me?",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_02": "My dear Hans, I'll help you escape.",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_03": "Hans?! I'm a girl, you must have confused me with someone else.",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_04": "Don't talk nonsense, dear. I won't confuse you with anyone.",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_05": "Father has a key, he keeps it in the bedroom.",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_06": "Key? Will it help? Thank you!",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_07": "Hurry Hans, they'll get you!",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_08": "Madam, are you okay? I can help you get out of this place.",
   "Actor5_08_Elsa_09": "They'll try to stop us, Hans. My father and Marta. They're not human anymore...",
    "Actor5_08_Elsa_10": "We can do it together. We're stronger than they think.",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_01": "Thanks for your help mate! If it wasn't for you...",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_02": "Hans, I'm glad you're alive!",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_03": "Hans? I'm Clarissa. Are you all right?",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_04": "Oh Hans, you need to hurry, your father is looking for you.",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_05": "What's wrong with you?!",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_06": "Darling, the key you need is in your father's bedroom, take it and run.",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_07": "Key? Thanks for your help mate. Probably.",    "Actor6_08_Elsa_08": "Hans... Take care of yourself.",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_09": "Girl, I came back for you!",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_10": "What are you doing, Hans? Run and don't look back!",
   "Actor6_08_Elsa_11": "So I will. But I won't leave you here alone.",
   "Actor1_09_01": "Fuck! Shit is everywhere in here! Fucking floor of a fucking hotel…",
   "Actor1_09_02": "Shit. Reminds me of bars after our show. Only a couple of drunken dudes are missing in the cut",
   "Actor1_09_03": "Who thought of bringing the teacher's desk in here? Hmph, reminds me of my mother, always disappeared at school.",
   "Actor1_09_04":"Haha! The punks know how to have fun. Although a human face for a hot potato is a bit... harsh.",
   "Actor1_09_05": "Shit. The idiot who drew this clearly has a head problem.",
   "Actor1_09_06": "Amazing, damn it! Now the bed is yelling like a woman. Not a hotel, but complete fucked up…",
   "Actor1_09_07": "Fuck. Two smokers in a car. How the fuck is that possible!? Here! In a hotel! And why can't I get this out of my head!?",
   "Actor2_09_01":"It's amazing. Even animals don't defecate where they live. Although the person who left this trail is probably not far from the animals.",
   "Actor2_09_02": "Empty jars, wrappers and leftovers. The person who lives here is obviously not starving. But where does he get all this from? Maybe they feed him? Hah, good boy, hold the bone.",
   "Actor2_09_03": "How strange, the teacher's desk is in the Hotel. Hmmm... I got my first patient at school, Mr. Rodent. He was buried the very next day.",
   "Actor2_09_04":"Children. They play with a human face. Extremely curious. And what smooth edges, a professional surgeon obviously worked.",
   "Actor2_09_05": "Scenes of cruelty and violence, just like the original. Although if people were animals instead... Brrr.",    
   "Actor2_09_06": "It seems like you can hear the screams of a woman in this place. This hotel will always find something to surprise you. Maybe it's just boring?",
   "Actor2_09_07": "Just look. A burned-out car with two dead people in it. And for some reason I can't calmly look at it. There's so much unpleasant and important in it.",
   "Actor5_09_01": "Disgusting, the whole hall is filthy, what kind of pig lives here?",
   "Actor5_09_02": "Remnants of a great feast. I never would have thought that canned food could be opened this way.",
   "Actor5_09_03":"It's strange to see a teacher's table in a hotel. Yeah, as I remember now: <Selena, you're always in your drawings! You better get ready for class!>",
   "Actor5_09_04": "What an abomination! I really hope that the face is rubber, and it's all some kind of joke. Although the scene itself is not without grotesque beauty. Maybe Dali?",
   "Actor5_09_05":"Amazing. Beautiful technique. Capturing people's suffering so accurately. And your own.",
   "Actor5_09_06": "Is this... Is it a woman's screams or am I imagining it?",
   "Actor5_09_07": "Where is the burnt car from? And so familiar. I once saw a similar incident on the highway. But now, I feel such pain and bitterness. And the need to remember what I saw.",
   "Actor6_09_01":"What an abomination! Who could come up with the idea of going to the toilet in the corner like that!?",
   "Actor6_09_02": "A mess! Some people have never heard of sanitation!",
   "Actor6_09_03": "Wow! The teacher's table! Eh... We lacked so much in those years. The skin still itches from that cheap lousy uniform from the flea market.",
   "Actor6_09_04": "God! What a nightmare! Where are the kids from and why are they playing with human faces!? This hotel is a living hell...",
   "Actor6_09_05": "Terrible art! The painter should have exercised more. It helps keep the mind clear.",
   "Actor6_09_06":"Well, it looks like someone is screaming. Poor thing, I hope she's okay...",
   "Actor6_09_07": "Oh! What a monstrous picture, it will destroy me from negative emotions! But I just can't get it out of my head, I have to remember it ... Veronica, Eloise, forgive me!",
   "Matthias_09_01": "This is.. a picture. My picture. I remember it, the last work. Then, then oblivion, pain, anger... Me, who am I? Eloise, daughter, stay with your father, don't leave, you were just born. And already in a hurry, with mom, to mom. Where? Hungry, food, hungry ... ",
   "Matthias_09_02": "Beloved, dear, Veronica. Where is she? Academy, park. Together, once together. Who is this?",
   "Matthias_09_03": "Me, why am I looking at myself? A face. A familiar face, younger, farther. It's hard, it hurts, it's insulting, it's lonely. Children are cruel. So much anger in me, in them. Exit, find a way out. Dad? Where are you? Why isn't he there? Go, go far. And you can go, go. Free. We'll all go. You go. I'll go..."
